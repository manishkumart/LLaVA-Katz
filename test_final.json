I don't know whether you guys know about the use of ChatGPT is it just released the version 4 yesterday night.  can any one of you who has that or tries to have a version or do these systems experience? No. Yes or no. That's it. That's important. It's totally the same, but it is an upgrade. So previously, it was ChatGPT version of 3.5 turbo.  This time, they have upgraded to the version 4. You should have a better capacity, you know, is make a prediction, or make other. And also, even force for the image as an input for you. So previously, it can only input text.  But this time, you really complete with the multimodal data sets. So, actually, you can just input the images. In the demo, the issue that a bunch of which are kind of amazing, they can quickly write a website for me to give you my   image like that way.   And also, if you can find some strange document cannot picture the 1 that can find some strange voices during the picture.  To say which part is, not correct, not correct. Alright? I think you probably let's try to play some fun thing here. I'll try to integrate your homework and ChatGPT."

So later, I will send a lecture to you, you can take a look at neural network content.  So in this case, I would like to introduce and advanced topic. That is part of vision transformer. In tomorrow's class, I mentioned a little bit about vision transformer. Right? Did I mention? So vision transformer. Did I mention it?  No idea? So then that you remember that I mentioned it? No. did anyone remember? No. Not at all? Vision transformer is for vision task and it use a specific method to process the image. Exactly. So, actually, I introduce you a little bit about the vision transformer, in our cl;ass for image classification task.  I did not inform too many details.
