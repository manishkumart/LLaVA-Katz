No. Yes or no. That's it. That's important. It's totally the same, but it is an upgrade. So previously, it was ChatGPT version of 3.5 turbo.  This time, they have upgraded to the version 4. You should have a better capacity, you know, is make a prediction, or make other. And also, even force for the image as an input for you. So previously, it can only input text.  But this time, you really complete with the multimodal data sets. So, actually, you can just input the images. In the demo, the issue that a bunch of which are kind of amazing, they can quickly write a website for me to give you my   image like that way.

No. did anyone remember? No. Not at all? Vision transformer is for vision task and it use a specific method to process the image. Exactly. So, actually, I introduce you a little bit about the vision transformer, in our cl;ass for image classification task.  I did not inform too many details.
