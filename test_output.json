Try to save the model to predict your label. Can predict your model? Big the label. Your target. Yeah. For a little type of target of probably new data. Right? But our key goal is that we want to minimize the probability of models\u2019 prediction errors in the future data-wise, so basically, once you get some predictions you need to make sure that you have a minimum error. Right? Otherwise, feel free to make predictions, right, and our goal is to have the highest accuracy. And as there are probably two competing methodologies, first one, we need that, you can try to build one really good model. So, this is an additional approach. Another one we build the many models that inherit your results, and this is the related data. But we want to discuss that about the ensemble learning here."

And then, the first step we're gonna try to create some multiple data sets. Should it be like a subset of the original data set or it's like a random split? Another random split is about random reordering your original dataset. So, yeah, in this case, you will get A D1 D2 to DT here. And then in step 2, you try to view the multiple classifier, and then each a classifier has trend to buy, which is the origin. There won`t corresponding dataset here. So, after that, we will have a bunch of classifiers from C1C2 to CT here, and in the last step, you guys need to combine all these classifiers together so that you can form a more powerful classifier. In order to improve your accuracy of the model. Student 1: Why? Why can we create another typical data? Professor: It is not that typical of the data, but it should be like a subset of your dataset. Student 1: Why can you train on the whole data? The idea classifies with different classifiers, a little bit of different data sets. So that you can find a different variance of each model. Yep. That's a good question."

The second solution is to add a can, try to use Google, and randomly look at one user's review for a couple of restaurants. And your service solution is to try to use also use Google, and then look at how multiple users will use it. Or a couple of white runs, and then try to average their rates.

And then in solution 2, on the other hand, if you try to just randomly pick up person's a star rating for a restaurant on the internet is much less accurate. They're but it's also easier, easier to find. Right? For the last solution, you have found that either collectively can be just the right amount of your accuracy, probably your need, and it is easier to find them overall over the Internet. And, essentially, it is a mess biased, since the users who have the rate data, and restaurants have come from various banks Right.

Let's say now with that, hey, as I just can now I probably maybe sunny, cloudy, sunny, cloudy, cloudy I think those are the real. Less, let's say, 5 different models try to predict your weather. Having in the first 1, this is, this is prediction. I would tell you, like, how many wrong predictions are here. Three, right? It should be easy to observe by experience. Wrong predictions. And the similar idea is the prediction from model 2, so how many wrong predictions are here? You probably get another 3 here. Right? What about this one? How many? 3? 3? What about in this case? You have to just get two wrong predictions. How many? Here. Here. So now the difference here is that we -- if we can see those combinations of all those predictions, it is more like what.? But like a majority votes. So, in this case, let's say, this prediction, what is the majority of prediction as well?  It's sunny or cloudy. Right? It should be this way, but what about this one? Sunny. What about this 1? Sunny. How about this 1? Should be cloudy here. Right? What about this 1? Cloudy. Cloudy again, what about this one? Sunny, and this sunny. So now, you can compare the similarity and the majority vote of all 5 different models. So now you can tell that is exactly the sample. So now you can see the power of the ensemble methods. As you really want to compare with all the existing different models so that you can combine offhand. Select the majority of those roles, all the averages of all the existing models, so that it can tell you the highest, accuracy amount of just different models. This is a general idea with okay.

Now let's say, what the details of the so-called bias or variance, so in the left hand, it is larger by a bias, and it is a small variance, the small variance is that your data sets are probably close to each other. As you can see here you go. But the answer is more like close to each other. However, since this test setting it's only concentrated either on this small problem. So, it has a larger bias, because it is only focused on this area, but it can grow our other apart. However, in the right hand, they should have, it has a smaller bias because it can consider also around this area. Other years it has a larger variance. Let's see.

We try out the decision tree for the begging method. A variance, the average of variance is equal to the variance of each model then divided by n, which means that we use back introduce that, we're more likely to reduce the variance of the data set, right? Because we have these kinds of n different models, I can add the details here. So, in a bagging method, we decreased error by decreasing the variance in the results due to unstable learners, and algorithms (like decision trees and neural networks) whose output can change dramatically when the training data is slightly changed. That's true? If we change a little bit about your training data set. Your final output can be very different. I can increase classifier stability/reduce variance."

In the first step, you need to create N subsets from the original dataset, one for each weak model. And then you create n subsets. Let's say, now you create 4 different subsets of original data. And 1, for each weak model, this is parallel. For each subset, if you need to train our weak model, and then you see, that's going through step 2, try each weak model of this with an independent subset in parallel, in parallel, transition. So now, I can get 4 different weak models here. From weak model 1 to weak model 4 here. So, eventually, in stage 3 either then you go to test the stage. So, predict from each and you have a prediction from each weak model here, then perform the majority, but so that you can get as a ton of predictions. Right. So actually, for this package, you should be suitable. What's the best thing about this is that a way of predicting and exactly applying this kind of strategy. Right?

Remember in the beginning, we talked about it is parallel for different models. Right? But for boosting is more like sequential training. Once you finish the first one, you can put in the second one. So, here's so policy, then you can arrive. Eventually, you're more likely to have a combination of all those different classified GM here, alpha here, just means you have about is more like how weight is here, and this is the sign function. So, what is the sign function here? Well, we will review it anyway. But now let's continue. So, each classifier Gm(X) is trained from a weighted Sample of the training Data."

Our first step is probably like you need to initialize your weight. That's w =1/N, I=1,...,N. Which means that it should be equally important when you have 8 examples, there's 1, divided by n. Then from different classifiers from small m, that is equal to 1:M. When to your capital m here, you will try to fit the classifier Gm(X) that is either in negative 1 or 1, if you can't the data use a weighted WI, which means that your Gm(X) should be a binary classification. Right? It should be is negative 1 or positive 1. And then you needed to calculate the error. And notice that you needed to remember a little bit about this, like that was, it's an error. It's calculated by the nominator. The first of the weight, then comes with the I(S). You needed to check whether your prediction is correct or not, right? Because then you get the sum of all the weights times ways, whether that is correct, prediction or not. As I divide by the whole of weights here, so you can get heavier than this error, so called epsilon here. So next that you're more likely to compute as an alpha, So the alpha is defined by a log, 1 minus error and it's just this 1, let you divided the error. Typically, we all have 1 over 2 as it is constant. But since it is logarithm, you can try to go 1 over 2. The next few slides, when we talk about some calculation you guys need to remember how to use it, 1 over 2 here. And then in the last step key, you're more likely to update in your weight. Right? So, w t again, you can use double t times with EXP, what is EXP here? It is, like, exponential map, but there are, essential here. So that is alpha, we get this alpha here, and I is just over there whether it is a correct prediction or not. Right? And in this case, you can try to update whether you can get good results now big. So that's what I put in the next slide."

Let's say you will have 3 different weaker classifiers the means that you try to use decision tree, classifies another example. Here is the example of positive 1 or negative 1. You'll have how many positive 1 here. You'll have 5 positive 1 and how many let's take 1. You'll have another file. Right? So, in the beginning, lesson, we have Level them all as 1, 1, just 1 here. So next, let's say, remember about in the beginning what is our first step? We needed to initialize our ways, which means that WRI is equal to 1 overhead. Right. Which means that you just get a done. 1, divided by the whole number of examples. Same example, what is the initial weight for each part? Well, over what? 5 over 10, right? So then, you just get a 0. 1 for all of these 5 different examples to write. So, let's say we have a first classifier, I have f1(x) here, which means that if we are in left, f1(x) which really is as a positive, everything is right hand of the f1(x) we're seeing about is negative. Which means that we have got some predictions of using the f1(x) here. So then, upon that, this two predictions as positive and others are not positive on the predictions. Right? In the next column, next column in 1 I could calculate is the error. Does it have a means what? Wrong predictions. There are wrong predictions here, right? So, for the first 1 level you combine, you try to compare the ground truth, so why here is the ground truth and the predictions is here. So, upon that, they are the same. So, the error is 0. And similarly, here, the prediction is probably 0. But I found that there are some predictions that they are not agree with each other. Right? Which means that there are some wrong. So that will be given. There's 1 here, 1 here, 1 here. So, you get a three 1 is missing value. E = (0.1*1+ 0.1*1+ 0.1*1)/1 = 0.3; a = \u00bd log(1-0.3)/0.3) = 0.42; If correctly classified: W=w* e-d = 0.1* 0.65 = 0.065; If wrongly classified: W = W * \u00b0 = 0.1 * 1.53 = 0.153."

Let's say, if we use is our left hand, it is more likely to have all as positive, and then even it is in the right hand, all our predictions are negative. So, in this case, you know how many wrong predictions are getting here. You have 3 wrong predictions again. Right? Next, you will notice how you calculate some. This is the epsilon and alpha again about that. Remember previously in this case, we already calculated about this new weight, right? This is a new weight 0 point 0155 and a 0 point 153. So here it's becoming as new weight. This is new weight. Can sum up what is the sum of it, what is the sum, the weight? Now, please verify, but it is equal to 1 now, accurate as this one. This is the new way to develop, from previous example. Right? What is it somehow with this column? It's less than 1. What is a rough number? 0194. Like this is a rough number right. So that in the case, you will notice that why it is important to write. So, another way, you may able to normalize the data, how to normalize this weight, how to normalize it. Any idea how normalizes it? Yes, you need to divide by the sum of all this power so that you can calculate then, so if this is normalized, you try to sum them together, you should get a 1 here in this case. So now, the next step is also, similar as before, you try to calculate as a weight of the original, another object that could be new, normalized the weight. So now tell me how you calculated this. It's the e here. What is the result of what you see based on this new weight. Remember, previous, we calculate devices to popularize this function right. As a function, should be So in your weight, time always error. So now in this case, what is your new epsilon here?  Now remember, we have some wrong predictions. Should it be some 3 negative. Right? So, in that tube, 3, 3 neck tubes should be corresponding in this error. Right. So, other 3 negatives. What is the e here? 0. 2S3. How can you get number? But what about others? Did you know how long it does this epsilon here? Oh, you got on epsilon this prediction. So, calculate error. Yes. We already calculated it.  Here are 3 wrong predictions for the business 3 are wrong. What is the final answer for d here? Now you can lose it. Right? But about others, you know how is the e here. So, on the what? 0.195. Okay. Is it difficult? I'll say is that you did not follow-up by the key thing is that, let's say, with one focus under the 3 predictions, worried about the normalized weight. It should be just 0 point 071. But, so now we have 3 times. It should be 0 point 071 times with 3. That's what you'd rather get an answer. Right? You know how did you get it here? Do you get an answer? How we get it up? Wait too here. No? No. We just have there's a 3 wrong predictions. Right? So, it's a 3 out of 1. So, these are the new, these are the 3. So, we need to focus on this, this is the weights. WIs each weights should be 0. 71. And here is how we calculate it. It should be in the first of mine, 0.71 times with y, because the guy is buying 1 prediction. That price another 0 point 071 times what, that price 0 point 071 times 1. So, you went to divide by 1 because you already know So you can get a 0. 21 as you have someone here. Right? You got it That's right. What about our online students? Do you get it? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So, then you have park in this episode to this alpha so that you can get this number So you actually get a 0.1515 as your alpha here. And then, eventually, we'll gather this phenomena. You update the graph so that in this case, you have epsilon 2, is equal to 0. And the other 2 is equal to 0. 22 that are already calculated. So, you eventually can try to update the original picture here to remember, previously, we had this as very big problem because these 3 are the wrong predictions. Right? And, in this case, we have another typical big numbers because it has events are wrong predictions. Right? So that in the next stage, we are also focused on those 3 different wrong predictions here. Remember, when we talk about the we calculate is that if so and how far the next step is, do what. You need to update what. The weight. Right? Remember goes through this screen. Again, again, it's just how we're updating this weight."

So, typically, you're gonna have, like, the error rate becomes bigger, and, alpha rate becomes smaller, right, as you want to evaluate, and we have high rates on the substandard ties and correct. And in the right hand, we use more out of the error rate with w, the weight patterns, where it's exponential, this property should be just I wish you needed to make sure that it becomes smaller and smaller.

This need to be a non-perfect long choppy. It is the first step, then you go to step 2. Like, I just need a few of the weight then you go to the second. But weak class model 2 here, so opposite if you work a little bit, another alpha two, and then you try to adjust the weight of it, weight classifier by number 3, you can get another number of 3 here, and after that you can get another 1, the fourth, that\u2019s fine. So that's the sure product. It is a sequential model. Right? You'll finish the first 1, then you'll set the second 1 with the third 1 with the fourth 1. So given the problem, the first method is that it's called bagging. So bagging is you can do it or you have it there by other than the fourth. At an adaboosting, you need to do it and do it this sequentially. Eventually, you can't buy another a majority of weighted to see it, so that they can get the correct prediction and then here, the bomb is ad boosting.

Stacking aims to create a single robust model, a single group box to model, from multiple heterogeneous strong learners. Remember about that, eventually, you want to create a singles. Through possible from previous strong learners. And stacking differs from bagging and boosting in that and it combines that very strong learners and they it combines heterogeneous models. What does this heterogeneous model mean here? What does this mean? What is What are heterogeneous models? Different models. The different models mean what? Yes. So, the heterogeneous model means that you use can use different algorithms. For example, you may try SVM.  You may need to train on KNN. You may need to train on   decision trees. But previously in the bagging and boosting we're more likely to talk about same types of methos, for example, decision trees. You may train lots of different decision trees. Right? But in this case, you are able to train different models. And in the second, it consists of creating a Metamodel. A metamodel is a model that created the using of a new data set. So now, well, I'll try to discuss some more useful about a new data set. Right, individual heterogeneous model, a are trained using an initial data set, those models, make predictions, and form a single new dataset, using those predictions. This new dataset is used to train new metamodel, which makes the final prediction. The prediction is combined using the weighted averaging. Now, you should notice that what is this new data set. The new data is what? So, these models make some predictions, right, give us some input. There are some those given models can make some predictions and then from a single new dataset and reduce these new predictions. By each model, you have some predictions or another model, you have another predictions. So then, you will try to aggregate all those data set together.

Stacking aims to create a single robust model, a single group box to model, from multiple heterogeneous strong learners. Remember about that, eventually, you want to create a singles. Through possible from previous strong learners. And stacking differs from bagging and boosting in that and it combines that very strong learners and they it combines heterogeneous models. What does this heterogeneous model mean here? What does this mean? What is What are heterogeneous models? Different models. The different models mean what? Yes. So, the heterogeneous model means that you use can use different algorithms. For example, you may try SVM.  You may need to train on KNN. You may need to train on   decision trees. But previously in the bagging and boosting we're more likely to talk about same types of methos, for example, decision trees. You may train lots of different decision trees. Right? But in this case, you are able to train different models. And in the second, it consists of creating a Metamodel. A metamodel is a model that created the using of a new data set. So now, well, I'll try to discuss some more useful about a new data set. Right, individual heterogeneous model, a are trained using an initial data set, those models, make predictions, and form a single new dataset, using those predictions. This new dataset is used to train new metamodel, which makes the final prediction. The prediction is combined using the weighted averaging. Now, you should notice that what is this new data set. The new data is what? So, these models make some predictions, right, give us some input. There are some those given models can make some predictions and then from a single new dataset and reduce these new predictions. By each model, you have some predictions or another model, you have another predictions. So then, you will try to aggregate all those data set together. So then, there is input for another supermassive model which it can make a final prediction."

In the step 2, what you need is that you try to train each week of model with the weak learner dataset. than those does have to use this 1 by 4 different learners. And then in a test station. So, yeah, you have a bunch of new datasets. So, you use this thing. In step 3, you need to train a metamodel for which the input is the output of the weak models for the meta learner dataset. Which means that you will take outputs or output labels from all those to 4 different models. Then it should be used for this substandard 2 here. So eventually, we'll try to announce that ensemble of all those predictions together, that you can get some majority goes up, blah, blah, so that you can get a final prediction. As this is a still conflict. Stacking, are you getting this part? So how this different from previous bagging and the boosting? So, in the future, during an interview, other people might ask you, what are the differences between bagging between the boosting and the between the stacking.

The bagging, trains N different weak models, usually of the same type it's so called homogeneous. Right? With N non-overlapping subset of the input dataset in parallel. Remember it is in parallel. And in the test phase each model is evaluated. The label with greatest number of predictions is as selected as the prediction. So, the methods reduce variance of the prediction. And they boosting. Trains N different weak models (usually of same types - homogenous with the complete dataset in a sequential order. The datapoints wrongly classified with previous weak model is provided more weights to that they can be classified by the next weak leaner properly. In the test phase, each model is evaluated and based on the test error of each weak model, the prediction is weighted for voting. Boosting methods decreases the bias of the prediction. And the last one is stacking trains N different weak models (usually of different types - heterogenous) with one of the two subsets of the dataset in parallel. Once the weak learners are trained, they are used to train a meta learner to combine their predictions and carry out final prediction using the other subset. In test phase, each model predicts its label, these set of labels are fed to the meta learner which generates the final prediction.

And in week 4 we talked about logistic regression model and least squares method after then for week 5 we talked about principal component analysis and factor analysis and then in week 6 we talked about matrix factorization which was very useful especially useful in recommendation systems. And then in week 7 we talked about gaussian mixture model and in week 8 we talked about clustering and then in the following week 9 we talked about nearest neighbor then we went ahead and talked about trees where we talked about decision trees in week 10 and then in week 11, we talked about support vector machines and then we had 2 weeks as a holiday. Then in week 14 we talked about vision transformers and then in week 15 we talked about ensemble learning and finally in today\u2019s week that is 16 we will talk about the next steps and your presentations; this is a brief summary of what we have studied in the machine learning class. Now you should be able to answers the questions in your interview especially about the machine learning like what is regression? What is classification? What is support vector machines and what is decision trees and etc."
