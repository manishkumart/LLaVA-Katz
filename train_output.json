My research and regular focus are on these 4 directions. So first of all, I'll majority of my papers, I focus on transfer learning. So specifically, I focused on as more domain for the domain adaptation. So later I will explain what the domain adaptation meaning here. Next, I am interested in manifold learning, which is kind of an expansion of space is different from our training space. And next, I am interested in the shape analysis, and this is really, relatively related to the medical field. And lastly, recently, I'm more focused on the audio denoising problem."

And during in our Machine Learning, we, we, we have like the training data set and test data. But in this case, we will refer our training data set as a source domain and our test data set as a target domain. So now as you can see there, you cannot see significant difference between your source domain and the target domain. So here, for example, those last 3 objects from the product domain, and here in just about the outline of the clipart domain. So now you will observe the difference between these 2 domains.  If you apply some existing Machine Learning models, you may not get a high accuracy. And those traditional machine models where include all models that I will cover in the fall semester. Which means that for those traditional methods, it will not get a very high accuracy. And similarly, we have another kind of data set. In the medical field, for example, we have the T1 images, and we have the flair images. If we try to segment the T1 images focused on the parameter, if we are then applying our model to the flair image, we will and not get a very good result because you see the difference between your tumor images and the flair images, and even worse, your source domain can be only like images, but your target domain can be just some text. Now you can direct the difference between images and the task. Right? And then this is the problem of the domain adaptation that we want to mitigate. The difference between a training and a test domain."

But finally, I will only select the highest selection of them for your final grade. And lastly, it's about the final project. It's about 30 percentage. For that reason, your final project is like your first year come to my office, talk to me to select your favorite project, you want to work on, so then you need to write a quick proposal for that. At the last day, you need to present your final project, then do and maybe answer questions for your audience. I will not have any exams. But if you guys like exams, tell me, I will make an exam for you. Okay. I, I, I really hope some students tell me you guys want some exam. I can remove this grading system percentage lower if you guys can tell me some exams or final exam. Are you ready? Complete? No. No. Nobody likes exams. Okay. So, let's have to just keep this format. Professor: What about? Student: I have, I have one question about team members. Is there any limits of the numbers of members in a group? Professor: The team member you mean? Student: For the project or the final presentation? Professor: Yes. Yeah. So that's we are depends on your guys. If you guys sound like other at the most, I would like to say 2 students per group. Because, totally, we have around 12 students. Right? So, at the most, like, 2 person in 1 group, but you can do it by yourself. I think in that case, you will get some kind of extra points for that if you're doing it by yourself. Okay. Student: Got it. Thank you. Professor: Any other questions? No. Okay. Great."

I think there's some of you probably already talked about some, something about the PCA. Right? Okay. Those are the few guys. After, we're gonna talk about the matrix factorization, and the Gaussian mixture model, basically, some neural networks, decision trees or a vector, and we have 2 weeks for holidays. Did you guys notice that? If not that I wanna tell you, you have 2 weeks at a holiday. It'll be a better time to start. And after that, we have, like, neural network, ensemble method, and then we are finished about the whole semester. I have to emphasize that. So, all, like, all the contents in this Machine Learning course are very important to you. Because of your future interviews, they definitely will ask questions from this machine learning class. Remember about that. And even if they will ask you to implement some of these algorithms. Previously, like, one of the algorithms happened to be that is about this decision tree. The interviewer will ask you to implement or reimplement this decision tree from scratch. So, so then, during this homework, you guys are ready to think about the first, like you have an interview. How you can implement those algorithms by yourself. Okay. That is very important. Any questions so far? No?; Student 1: Do we have the final project? Professor: Yes, let's go try to find it into our syllabus again. So, here is the all content that I will cover in the whole semester. As you can see here, we have like final project and some implementation of it. In middle, you only have like thirteen different homeworks. Each of them, you will have a kind of smaller work. Student 1: So, are all the projects independent for that or like a team works? Professor: You mean the homework? Student 1: No. The projects. Professor: The final project, as one student asked, it can be teamwork, but it depends on. It's no more than two persons. Student 2: And for the next interview. Professor: Yeah. For homework, just in the interview, some very small, small work. Like today, we will, I'll ask you guys to answer; What is machine learning and what is the future of it? Maybe next class, I want to give you guys a little bit easy stuff to that. And then for the other middle, I might need you guys to implement it from scratch. So, you treat them carefully, and like during your interview how you will implement those kinds of algorithms. Like Gaussian mixture model, how you will implement. How you will implement the Decision Tree. Right? If you guys are ready, it's a very good job in this class. I mean, in a future view, in a future view, ask you the same questions. We have no question about that. You have immediately implemented. You definitely have a good impression on them. So, they might need might hire you immediately, hopefully. Okay?"

What do you think about Artificial Intelligence? Okay. Good. What about other thoughts? What do you think about Artificial Intelligence? Yes. Exactly. What about other thoughts? This is so. Yeah. It's still kind of. What about other thoughts from online students? Your mind, what do you think about Artificial Intelligence? And did you notice some difference between AI and Machine Learning? Which one is bigger? Yeah. Student 5: If a variety is Machine Learning some of way implementing AI. And since this, AI is a set of methods that can use methods can study by itself to solve some problems. Professor: Yes. Exactly. You got it. In the next few slides, we are first introducing AI and then we are talking about Machine Learning. So, we will talk about AI a little bit.

There are I only here just mentioned the, like, of 5 different aspects, like the 'Explainable AI', 'Metrics and Bias Assessment', 'Verification & Validation' is more like you like your phone, you use a face to unlock it. Right? And the 'Security', the other is about some 'Policy', 'Ethics', 'Safety', 'Training' problem. And also, there are a lot of modern, modern, like, computing devices as you are seeing on. You definitely guys see CPUs. Right? You know about the GPUs. I've been watching that you already heard about that. And you probably notice about the GPU, which is more robust work than CPU, and you have this 'Custom' and the 'Quantum' computing and other staff. Right? But before, again, those cannot use in Machine Learning models, like that data is always our first task. Right? Altogether, data, here is about 'Data Collection', 'Data Management', like 'Data Labeling'. Especially the amount that the 'Data Labeling' is a big challenge for all existing Machine Learning. For those, you definitely need to provide feedback about a data set. So, in that initial stage, it's a requirement for humans to provide something. So, that is a bit of a reason why 'Data Labeling' is now still very challenging. Also, we have so many different implementing models or Machine Learning models, but 'Data Labeling' is also a very difficult process. And after that, we have some algorithms, yeah, just several different types. Like, 'Unsupervised Learning', 'Supervised Learning', we also have 'Reinforcement Learning', etcetera. Another side, we have, like human and computer interaction so that we can get better performance. So, for the human and the computer interaction, the HCI, and it really would take a little bit longer time than single computer models. But, you know, it'll get a much higher accuracy. So, love it, this area is also very popular. And also, we have several other applications. So, let's mention 1 of all those applications. Any questions? No, okay. Great."

So, you already noticed that Machine Learning is just a branch of AI, but what are the details of them? So, for the AI, in that scientific field concerned with the development of algorithms that allow computers to learn without being actually programmed, but for the Machine Learning is just a branch of it which focuses on methods that learn from data and make predictions on unseen data. And then for the Machine Learning, we really care about prediction, channel, that kind of prediction. Right? So, here is the general process of Machine Learning. So, during the training stage, we have a labeled data set. What about label data set? Student 1: Labels are input data. Professor: What do you mean by labeled input data? Student 1: Features and labels. Professor: Features and labels. Yeah. Yes. Exactly. I agree with that. What about other labels in the data set? Oh, you, you questioned that? What is the label of the data? Okay. Great. Yeah. Go ahead. Student 2: A label data? Professor: Yeah. The label data. What is labeled data? Student 2: I think, we can have some datasets, for example, we have several samples, and each sample has some labels that it identifies some class, for example. Professor: Yes, good. I see you guys now appreciate it. Right? So, the label of data will provide some labels for the datasets. For example, like images, give an image of a cat. The label is a cat. You have labeled it. So, it is a labeled data set. Right? So, for example, you've got stock price prediction sold on stock price of your labels of it. Right? Give you give you your time series data. And, yeah, another stage of Machine Learning is called 'prediction' or called the test stage. We have another kind of labeled data set. But we will use this time, we will try to use trained Machine Learning models based on the training stage we can check to make some predictions, for the test data set and then even we want to evaluate the performance the performance of the Machine Learning models. Right? Any question? Okay. Student 1: Is Reinforcement Learning in this category? Professor: I do not have yet that yet. In few slides, but Reinforcement Learning is different from those, so here we will see it. Okay? That's a good question."

But does that mean? Where they're increasing our age, definitely they see more and more images. Right? What about the word? And that's about our children. So really humans learn from experience. Right? Once or sometimes if you make a mistake in that first case, you'll probably, in the next time you try to avoid it. Right?

If I ask you how to write a program like a pseudo code to identify a cat, to identify a cat in an image. How would you do it? Any ideas? Student 1: You mentioned. I'm not very good to do. And I'm here. No ideas, but traditional model is bigger. Professor: Yes. That's a very good spectrum. What about some thoughts about your guys? Use traditional programming, how to identify this cat? Any thoughts? It comes without a result, still without a solution. So, we really talk about some, in the early stage, without computer vision problems. But the kind of the easiest solutions you can think of to how to distinguish, whether this is a cat or not. What about online students? Do you guys have any thoughts? How can you write a program about identifying whether this is a cat? Student 2: For example, if, for example, if some type, like, triangle, and for each for each part of body, like, for example, for eyes, eyes like green or black. And for and for each, for each type of body to make some if statement and check if it's related to the cat or not. Professor: Good. You have a similar solution to your classmate. So, let's see. Student 3: Can I say something, professor? Professor: Do you have another solution? Student 3: Yeah. Yeah. So first, we convert this RGB image to black and white image, and then we make a decision. We can make a classifier like logistic regression classifier or gradient boosting classifier, which classifies the image? Professor: Yeah. So, actually, your answer is similar to Juju. You did use that. This is the more likely some kind of advanced solution."

For example, we want to detect the color, we want to detect the shape, we want to detect the length. And we have so many different if-else statements, so finally to decide whether that is correct. But 1 question is, is that enough? How many those standard if-else statements do you needed to make? How many? You don't know right. Even than better, right? Because there are so many parts of the image, right? And this is the big. So that's very about some traditional programming, because traditional programming is, we're not a care about the images, the computers classify itself, right? Only care about some small staff, how to make them together. But in this case, the Machine Learning is more likely think of a whole image, not just for example, or small parts."

As usually the knowledge engineering bottleneck, if you have your own data set, data set especially in industry, every company even has their own data set. Right? In that case, you need to build your own model again, create some labels, retrain this situation that you cannot prevent. So, this is called the bottleneck. Why do we have that? To develop systems that can automatically adapt and customize themselves to individual users. For example, personalized news, the mail filtering. For example, sometimes, you have some app, and give you some exceeding news that you care about that. Right? But keep give your some coming out in this file. And also in your mail, so every day you get lots of spam email. Right? So, you can also detect that. Nothing is about personalized tutoring. We also can discover new knowledge from large database. This is really about the data mining part. For example, about the market basket analysis.

And then also there's another key reason that we wanna use Machine Learning as we want to include some existing Machine Learning models. Right? And also, there are availability of large volumes of datasets, and we want to make a sense of data. So, nowadays, it's very easy to get a lot of data sets. Right? There's a lot of images from your phone. But do you want to segment your images on your phone? Do you want to do that? Then you find an object in your phone image. No one wants to do that. It's not necessary. Right? So, in your data set, if you can't do label it, there is no sense in this data. And also, that CRM custom customized software. For example, the speech recognition, software or spam filter, color detector, and all of those part that so we want to use Machine Learning, and this is the key reason why Machine Learning nowadays is so popular and important."

For the Unsupervised Learning, we will have, like, the Clustering, the Dimensionality Reduction, the Unsupervised Density Estimation. And the lastly about the Reinforcement Learning. So, after Reinforcement Learning, firstly, doesn't use labeled unlabeled data in the traditional sense. In the Reinforcement Learning, an agent learns via its interactions with an environment, so-called feedback-driven policy learning. So, we will care about its feedback from the interactions between your environment. And there are also, let me come out with any message that I need to mention, let's say, the Semi-supervised learning that we've already mentioned. And we have Active Learning. We have Transfer Learning. We have the Multitask Learning. We have, like, Imitation Learning. So here, a kind of related to the Reinforcement Learning. And we have Few-Shot Learning in nowadays, and I don't know whether some of you have heard about that or not. And even we have the Zero-Shot Learning in Machine Learning. We probably have no labels or data set but we still can predict them, so-called the Zero-Shot Learning. This is a kind of fancying learning algorithms, but we'll not cover in this class.

So, all of those are numerical classifier functions, and you will have some parametric functions, parametric or probabilistic. Specifically, they are related to some probability kink of function, like Naive Bayes discriminator, Gaussian discriminant analysis the GDA, the HMN, the hidden Markov models, the probabilistic graphical models. And we have non-parametric models. So, this is related to some instance-based functions. For the non-parametric models, they need just that those models very depend on data set. They don't care about some kind of parameters. For example, the KNN the k-nearest neighbors. It cares about its nearby instance, right? The kernel regression, and also similar to kernel density estimation, some local regression. And we have, we have the symbolic functions, like the decision trees, the classification, the regression trees. Right? Decision trees for as I can apply for this period to the task list.

So, given a bunch of images of training data set, labeled data set, let's find these images like in the box, the cat. After we used some kind of feature extraction, and with its labels, we will try to train some Machine Learning algorithms. And after that, we can try a good predictor to detect whether it's cat or whether it's dog. Right? So then, keeping any test image. Also, after feature extraction, we can get some predicted labels. Right? However, why important the process is called feature extraction. What does that mean? And here, what is feature extraction? Student 1: Taking the specific qualities of that content, but we are giving those labels. Professor: Yes. Any other thoughts about feature extraction? Student 2: We have some data, we have some information, but we're using some methods. We can get some more information from the data, some additional information. Professor: Yes. It can be yes, exact! Specifically, more about the feature extraction is like some kind of method to extract some key features from data. So, here, it is images. The key features from images. For example, those cats, if you want to extract some corners, some conture information, some boundary information. So, those are so-called the super power features that we can extract. But, in our machine learning class, we will not talk about how to extract features. But in our another different learning class, we will talk about how to extract those deep features or in the traditional features. I think, maybe all you, guys, should take that Deep Learning class. Right? I guess, you've already registered. Right? You already did that. Yeah? Last semester. Yeah. But again, for the feature extraction, you guys will learn in tomorrow's class. Okay. So, later you will get more sensitive of it."

After you do feature extraction, and can get this kind of one-dimensional vector for each image, and also you try to train some machine learning algorithm. You have, like, these different clusters. So, this is really based on some clustery method. Right? For example, that like some KNN, k-nearest neighbor. You will probably choose, the given the K is equal to 1, you will definitely choose the most of closed samples as in the same category. So, for example, if these two cats are very close to each other, you say, you're thinking they should be in 1 category right, and you can put it here. But if you find this cat and this dog, they are different from each other, like distance between these 3 images is big. So definitely, you need a support into 2 different classes. Right?

As you can see here, you'll probably have your environment state. You have several states for that state S. If you try move, so which state. And for example, you will play this little game, you have some kind of observations whether you can jump, whether you can feed something, whether you can eat something. Right? And you will get some reward, so rewarding typically about your score. So, if you can jump some obstacles, you will get a high score, right? So that is so-called reward in this case. The action, action doing, in this case, is maybe just about to move forward, move back, or jump, right? Those support that 4 different actions that you can perform in this task. And out there, you have some agent state. So, after you perform a kind of action, you will jump to another state. For example, if you take action for walk, you can move to that forward step, right? You make some reward; you'll get some score or you'll lose score. So that's probably reward here. But anyway, you guys will learn more details about that in the AI, Artificial Intelligence course or Reinforcement Learning class. And specifically, for one student who says that he's interested in gaming, this is very important for you, these two classes. The AI and this Reinforcement Learning.

And we have for the Probabilistic Graphical Models, we will talk about Naive Bayes, and Bayesian networks, the HMM, and even about Markov network.

Any of you have already tried that? You tried that? What about you guys? Don't? So, now you guys have chance, officially, revenue in this class. I will require you guys also to provide some answers from ChatGPT. Answers. Okay? So basically, which means that you will upload two files, two text files. Include a question and your answer. For example, your question just; What is Machine Learning and what is the future of Machine Learning? But for that ChatGPT you must modify these questions a little bit. Because it can give you some different answers. You just, you definitely want to get different answers from your classmates. Right? But the case about your own answer, always remember to write your own sentence, because in this time, I will check it, use online, a kind of detection tool, if you have come some sentence a copy from online. You probably have some trouble with that. I think you guys have already covered about academic integrity. During the orientation. Right? So, that is very important. I do not want to say that details of it, but again, try to remember it. Do not copy it from online, do not copy it from your classmates. Okay? It's okay, it's easy. Yes. Yes. Exactly.

Of all you want to find a job, right? And that case is about practice and practice. As you guys already did, like, a small interview practice, like, some similar concept. And I don't know whether you guys know about Leetcode. Anyone knows about it? No? For those who didn\u2019t know about this website, you can try to and we can open with advice. This is the real about website that has lots of questions, especially, it contains some interview questions for your guys. Can you see now? So, this is the website of Leetcode. So, after there are lots of, like, questions, like, especially if you are interested in the Python, you guys just look at Python, you can you are interested in other languages, like C, C++ or even Java, there is lots of resources. You can do that. And I think, it should be a good time for you guys to start a bit with it. Especially, and it has lots of interview questions for those top companies, like from Google, from Meta, from Amazon, there are lots of questions, interview questions, to make sure you have time to practice with it, to challenge yourself. I think, you guys might get a similar interview question during your future interview. I guess, here, I like well, lots of questions. You needed to take a run like one year or one year half to fish all of them, but please make sure that you select the most useful questions for you guys. If you target in the future, you're really about to find a job immediately. I highly recommend you guys to start to play with it. Okay. Yes. Oh, for those online students, can you see the screen? Student 1: Yes. Student 2: Yes, professor. Professor: Can you see the screen about the Leetcode? Student 3: No, we only see the slide. Professor: But I think there should be a link in the slide. Right? So, later, to print and make sure you look at it and really start to work on some questions. Okay? So, this is about, I think it should be one major task for you guys in the future, right?"

The first reason like typical you will focus on doing some professional Research, especially you will become a professional researcher here, and then you definitely will practice with some cutting-edge technologies. Some state of art methods. It is not like the main country. It is some of the industry companies they are old. Still are using some techniques around, like, 10 years ago or even 30 years ago. And now, if you really want to pursue the PhD degree, you definitely need to do some state of art methods. And secondly, definitely, if you publish some papers, the publications will be kept forever. Right? So, eventually 180 years later, you can show something to the world. Right? The second reason, definitely, once you get a PhD degree, you can get a much higher salary, this should be true. However, saying that if bachelor students or master students use another 5 years, you'll probably have a similar salary which means that typically for a PhD degree, you need, like, 5 years to get it. But at the beginning salary should be similar to another, like, bachelor students with 5 years of experience. Right? However, for a PhD degree, you definitely have better career prospects. For example, in many companies for master\u2019s students or bachelor\u2019s students, you probably cannot be a manager. But if you hold a PhD degree, you'll probably become a manager. So, that's really about talk about your future career. Like for the final goal, right? And the final destination, right? But to get a PhD degree, you will apply for a PhD degree, you definitely needed to focus on the research. Right? So, this is very important for you guys for those who are interested doing research. And then you want probably, if you still want to apply for a PhD degree. So, if you want to do some research. It generates the funding, and we try to give you some kind of projects for your better experience if you apply for a PhD degree. Okey? So, this is about the best security directions in the future.

And in the second interpretation of a vector, the direction in space. For example, the vector v is equal to 3 and 2, it's okay. Often, we are writing its transpose at the direction of 3 steps in the right and the 2 steps up as you can see probably here.

Student 2: The model? Professor: The model? Kind of like a model. So, what about this line? Any other guess? Student 3: Sorry, professor. Could you please, could you, could you please repeat question? Professor: Oh, the question is, so, what do you think about this line? In the Machine Learning, it's another term about this line. Say it again. Student 4: Regression? Professor: Regression? A kind of, but not exactly. Student 5: Classification line? Student 2: Task classification line. Professor: It's a kind of close. So, actually, this line has, I think about, like a hyperplane here, right? So, later we will cover about the hyperplane. There is a plane to separate these two classes. But here, it's not about lines. It's just a kind of a plane. But later, we will cover more details about it, what is a hyperplane, how to separate these two different classes, right? Or, it can improve, it can help to visualize zero-centering and normalization of training data. So, in this case. So, for example, this red is the original data. So, the middle one is the zero-centered data, and the right one is normalized data. What does this zero-centered data mean? Anyone about it what is the zero-centered data? Anyone knows about this meaning of the zero-centered data? What does this mean? You can try to compare about the left, this one and this one. You see any changes between this blue one and the green one? Student 6: In the center, the data is close to the zero. Professor: Yes, you have a good catch about that. So, basically, the zero-centered data, the mean of the data is equal to 0. So, that you can see that. This data is shaped to the center that is so called zero-center. What about normalize for that listening? Student 3: And I think. Professor: Kind of like that. Sure. You want to, like, convert your data to some kind of skill. Right? Why do you want to do normalization? Why do you want to do that? Student 2: Because we have outliers. Professor: Outliers? Student 2: Outliers, prevent from our data. Professor: A kind of. What about another guess? Why we want to do that? Yes, something like that. It's better. Okay. So, the reason we want to normalization is that we want to unify our data in some scale. For example, we will typically, we try to normalize our data between minus 1 and 1, right? So, that you can see the majority of data set. And another case, it is useful for your Machine Learning, particularly in that. The normalized data you probably use less time to change, right? Because, think about it, if you input the original data, the scale of your data set can be wide, right? It can be very big. However, you can use, you use the normalized data. So, in that case, you will adjust the data set, concentrate with each other, rights? So, that you will have less time to train your model. That is another advantage to this normalized data. Okay."

And basically, this sum of all the elements. Right? It is also referred to as inner product, or scalar product of vectors. The dot product u times v is often denoted by u and v using this kind of brackets here. The dot, dot is a symmetric operation. This means that u times which v is equal to u transpose with v is that it's equal to v transpose with u, and also is equal to v times with you. Right? So, this already means about the symmetric operation. The geometric interpretation of the dot product; angle between 2 vectors. So, you're investing, this is about 2 different points, and here, a theta is just, just the angle between these 2 vectors. Right? And also, we can calculate by the dot product of v, the dot thought of this value that is using this equation based about what, what is this? The norm. Right? This is the norm of u and v times to the cosine theta. And also, the cosine theta is calculated by this equation, right, u dot with v over these two norms, the production of this. So, if 2 vectors orthogonal, which means the theta is just equal to 90. That cosine theta is equal to 0, then we can u times with b, that is equal to 0. Also, in the Machine Learning that cosine theta is very important. Because, sometimes it just means the cosine similarity so that we can measure the similarity between two vectors. For example, in the NLP, giving you 2 different entities, like 2 different texts. You want to calculate how similar of these two taxes where you want to calculate the cosine. So, now, another case of it, computer vision of artificial learning like give you three images, you want to measure how similar are they. So, also, you can calculate the cosine theta of these three images. So, that you have an idea of how similar of these three images. Right?"

So, l2 norm is often denoted just as the norm of x with the subscript 2 omitted there. So, typically, we will try to omit this too. Just to use this, denote this as a norm. If p is equal to 1, so we will call it as l1 norm. And they use the absolute value of the elements, and we can discriminate between zero and non-zero elements. So, actually, in the future, especially about some regression problem, you probably will use l2 norm or l1 norm, to try optimize them or your models. Let's say p is equal to the infinity. So, we have l\u221e norm. So, it's known as infinity norm here or maximum norm, as you can see in this screen. And we will output the absolute value of the largest element.

For example, we have 2D space. I have a hyperplane used as a straight line that is 1D. For example, in this case, because this is about a 2D space. So, a hyperplane is just a line. Right? In 3D, so, our hyperplane is a plan. So, typically, it's like a surface. As you can see in this example. So, this is 3D, and our hyperplane is really about a surface. Right? In a d-dimensional vector space, a hyperplane has \ud835\udc51 \u2212 1 dimensions, and divides the space into two halves of space. Now hyperplane is a generalization and a concept of training in high dimensional space. As you already have noticed that. In Machine Learning happens, you see boundaries. You use them for the linear classification as you can see in these examples. Data points falling in either side of the hyperplane are attributed to different classes. For example, if you are in the left, it should be one class. If you are in the right of the hyperplane, it should be another class. Right?"

So, that if you say all vectors, with w times with v that is even bigger than 1 can be classified as one class. So, this part. And all vectors that is less than 1 can be classified as another class, and this is typical about our classification problem. If we want to solve in the w dot b, that is equal to 1, we will obtain this kind of equation, right, but eventually, we will get the norm of v, the cosine theta that is equal to 1 over square root of 5. That is, to say, the solution is the set of the points which w dot v is equal to 1 meaning the points lay on the line that is orthogonal to the vector w. So, it has a typical symmetry in this case. And that is the line 2 of x plus y, that is equal to 1. And the orthogonal projection of v onto w, that is a norm of v, the cosine theta that equals to this 1 over a square root of 5.

So, that we have donated this a here, in this row. So, in each vector aiT has the size of m which means that each row will have like m elements. So, eventually, m elements. So, the matrix-vector product is the column vector of length m, whose i-th element is the dot product aiTx. For example, we want to find matrix A times with x. Basically, we will get product ax for each of their element. Right? So, notice the size of A, m by n, for x size is n by 1. Eventually, Ax has the size of m by 1."

This means that the two columns are linearly dependent. If you already can write two columns, a column times with another kind of member that is a measure column. We will say these two numbers are linearly dependent. For the weighted sum that is a1, v1 plus like a2, v2 refer to as a linear combination of the vectors b1 and b2. In this case, a linear combination of the two vectors exists for which b1 plus 2 times with b2 that is equal to 0. So, that is the linear combination of the vectors. Got it? So, a collection of vectors v1, v2, to vk are linearly dependent if there exist coefficients like a1, a2, to ak that we also notice that not all equal to zero to that.

You might have three channels, 3-dimnesional arrays. And the 3 axes correspond to width, height, and channel. For example, we have 224 by 224 by 3. So, we have three-dimensional tensors.

To begin with an intuitive explanation, the surface of the Earth is an example of a two-dimensional manifold embedded in a three-dimensional space. This is true because the Earth looks locally flat, let's say we choose minimum space which looks flat. Right? So, on a small scale it is like a 2-D plane. However, if we keep walking on the Earth in one direction, we will eventually go back to the same location. Right? So, this means that Earth is not really flat. It looks locally like 2D space, but at large scales it folds up on itself, and has a different global structure than a flat plane. Ok?"

For example, an n-dimensional manifold is defined as a topological space with the property that each point has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to the Euclidean space of dimension n. This means that a manifold locally resembles Euclidean space near each point. Let's say if we focus on one point on a manifold, it's like a 3D-space. Informally, a Euclidean space is locally smooth, it does not have holes, edges, or other sudden changes, and it does not have intersecting neighborhoods. Although the manifolds can have very complex structure on a large scale, resemblance of the Euclidean space on a small scale allows to apply standard math concepts. For example, we have 2-dimensional manifolds, this 3D sphere, we have torus, we have double torus, and we have Kleine bottle, here, right? The surfaces in the figure have been conveniently cut up into little rectangles that were glued together. Those small rectangles locally look like flat Euclidean planes where it is placed, again in Euclidean space. And, also for these manifolds some operations are different from our Euclidean space. For example, in Euclidean space, we will use one to one plus one that is two, right? However, in manifold, one plus one cannot be two."

So, most machine learning algorithms extract lower-dimensional data features that enable to distinguish between various classes of high dimensional input data. For the low-dimensional representations of the input data are called embeddings. Here, for example, we have a neural network, typically about input should be limited as 224 by 224 by 3. By eventually, the output can be like one vector. For example, if you have 1000 classes, one output just for it, 1000 dimensions. Right? You will reduce the dimensions about 224 by 224 by 3. Right? 1000 dimensions. So, in the new space, like 1000, so far, embeddings."

What means this h should be very small, right? Very close to zero. That is almost zero. Let's say if the f prime exists, f is said to be differentiable. If f prime c is differentiable for c is between a and b, then f is differentiable on this interval. Right? A and b.

Similarly, the approximation of fx with a Taylor polynomial of n-degree derivative is equal to this equation. That is most important for you guys. Similarly, we have this sum of the order mentioned. For example, the figure shows the first-order, the second-order, and the fifth-order polynomial of the exponential function fx = e to x at the point x0 equals to 0. So, this is x, and x equals to 0.

The gradient of the multivariate function fx with respect to the n-dimensional input vector x that is x1, x2, to xn transpose, is a vector of n partial derivatives. As you can see this gradient of x. That gradient of n partial derivatives with respect to x1, x2, to xn. Right? When there is no ambiguity, the notations these, these two are often used for the gradient instead of this nabla. Because this symbol nabla here, also pronounced gradient of f with respect to x. In Machine Learning, the gradient descent algorithm relies on the opposite direction of the gradient of the loss function L here with respect to the model parameters theta here for minimizing the loss function. So, adversarial examples can be created by adding perturbation. This is an example in the direction of the gradient of the loss L with respect to input examples x for maximizing the loss function. I know, sometime in the future, we will have a task with very about series of data. You guys will generate images, do some tech events.

So, when the process is repeated, a large number of times each outcome occurs with a relative frequency of the so-called probability. So, if a particular outcome occurs more often, we say, it is, it is the most probable. So, the probability applies to a contest. First of all, in actual repeated experiments. For example, you don't record as a power of 1000 cars, driving by 0.057 of them are grid. And then you estimate the probability of car being green, as you see clear, like 57 divided by 1000, so you eventually get rid of some small number, and this is so part the probability here. In the idealized conceptions of a repeated process. For example, you consider the behavior of an unbiased six-sided die. The expected probability of rolling a 5 is 1 by 6 which equals 0.1667. Right? That it should be That's same. Another example is that you need to you need a model for how people's height distributed, which is our normal distribution to represent as I expected the regular probabilities."

Non deterministic authorities in probability theory, it provides a mathematical framework of representing and quantifying uncertainty and there are several different sources of uncertainties. So, for example, the first 1 can be that any inherent stochastic history in the system being mode modeled as another concrete example, so most interpretation of quantum mechanisms describe the dynamics of some atom particles has been probabilistic. Another reason because the uncertainty can be the income, incomplete of the ability So even deterministic systems can appear, you know, stochastic, when we cannot observe all the variables at jobs or behavior of the system. Another reason can be the incomplete of modeling. So, while we use our model, that a master has covered some of the information we observed, that is part of information without the uncertainty in the model's prediction. So, for example, the discretization of real number of values that I mentioned negative reduction, etcetera. Right? Because of that, always unnecessary information. So, you would think that is unnecessary. But in terms of data, the cell phone you should be used for that was another reason of the uncertainty of the model."

So, we denote the event of seeing a 5, as equal to 5 or x that equal to 5 is this different equation. And as a probability, it's so called is donated is distributed. Also, the P5 can be used to donate as appropriate, is that x is a value of 5. Probability distribution is a description of how likely a random variable is to take each of its possible states. A compact notation is common. So were PX, the probability distribution of the random variable x. Also, the notation x that has the probability distribution p x can be used to donate as a random variable x as a probability of PX. And, definitely, for the random variable, it can be either it gets greater or the continuous that just creates a random variable. I have a finite number of stages.

For example, we may need to use several. For example, we may need to use the sum rule for example the probability of capital x is equal to small x and we sum all the probability across other kind of variables. Across other kind of variable than the y. So, as you can see here, either some or other probabilities across the y here. And for continuous run variable, summation has replaced by integration.

As noted from independent random variables that the PXY that is just equal to the times up to p x times with p y. In other cases, the random variables are dependent, for example, getting a king on successive draws from a deck, that can be drawn and not replaced.

And also here is the linear dependence without noise, it basically means that you can find a very clear relationship with each other. So, what about this nonlinear, especially, but nonlinear, you cannot even use this. Okay. Remember for this correlation, you reach us for nonlinear."

Like the Multinoulli distribution is called as a category called distribution or generalized Bernoulli distribution, but the Multinoulli is, like, probability distribution that describes the possible results of a random variable that can take 1 of over k possible categories. So, our category random variable is just discrete random variable with more than 2 possible outcomes, such as the roll of die. Machine learning, we have set our data example x1, x2 and corresponding to the data example xi as a k, class label. There is a yi equal y1, y2 to yin and k means different clusters, and it corresponds to 1 whole importing. In one hot encoding is also called 1 of k class label yi equal y1, y2 and so on yik representing one hot encoding. Let's denote the probabilities for assigning the class labels to a data example by p1, p2 to pk, we know that the pj should be between 0 and 1 and the sum of pj should be equal to 1 for different class of j from 1 to k. The Multinoulli probability of the data point, the xi is the probability of xi that it can be like it's a product of all the probability here. Right? So, similarly, we can take place the probability of all data. Examples as these come out and products of all of them together."

        "value": "Here are more details about the so-called the self-information. So, the basic intuition behind the information theory is that learning that an unlikely event has occurred is more informative than learning that a likely value has occurred. For example, a message you say the sun rose this morning. Should be all, you are nice but you notice about this 1. This is so uninformative that it is unnecessary to be sent. But a message is saying, there was a solar eclipse this morning is very informative, right, so that here. For self-information, we really care about some unusual information. So, based on that intuition Shannon defined the self-information of an event X and the equation for it is Ix equal to the negative log of the probability of x. So, ix is the self-information, and the p x is the probability of event x. So, that your self-information output is a piece of information received from the event x. So, for example, if we want to send the code off with 0010 over my channel. So, you got to 0010 is a series of code of that. And in this case, the last is and is able to move forward. Right? So, that encodings are bit 0 or 1 that occurs with the probability of 1 over 2. So, for instance, in this case, the p, the probability should be well over to or with the power of n so then, we can calculate the self-information. Of IX. The x is 0010. And here it's the equation, and here it's about its probability. So, you eventually calculate this. Okay. So, the self-information is for to recognize how the information, how big it is. And you spend your files in the big or event. This probability or just It's not just a probability because we take the negative log here. So, with the probability, which are we present how important of that independent. So probably when we are assigned, for example, in this message, we will assign more value to this information. Yes. But to why the result has 4 bits. Maybe yes. So, each code is about 1 bit. Right? So, once you calculate it by this equation, you will eventually get 4 bits. Right?"

So based on the expectation definition that is equal to this equation, we can rewrite the entropy as this can now be created. It basically means making all the event x across all the small x. Here, for example, PR, Probability or PX that comes with a lot of PX. So, if X is a continuous random variable, then follows a probability distribution p here, with a probability density function px for the entropy. So now, in this case, it should So, we have an integration in this case. Right? And for continuous random variables, the entropy is also called a differential entropy.

It can provide a measure of how different 2 probability distribution are. So, for our probability distribution PX and QX, it has QX over the same random variable x, the k l divergence is calculated in this kind of equation, and for our discrete random variables, this is equivalent about other some here. When base 2 logarithms are used kl of divergence provides the amount of information in bits. So, your machine learning is a natural logarithm is used, the best and there's a long-time information is provided and not there. So, KL divergence can be considered as the amount of information lost when the distribution Q is used to approximate the distribution P.

So, 1 KL is equal to 0, if I only the PSX and the QS, are the same distribution. But most important property of kl is that it is non symmetric, which means that this 1 is not only attached to each other. And because Kl divergence is no negative and it matters the difference between distribution is often considered as a distance metric between 2 distributions. However, kl divergence is not true distance metric, because it is not symmetric, and there's a symmetric method this does. Yeah. You order the equivalent to the choice of whether you use KR, KR, KR, Q over P. Of negative divergences called non negative, and the symmetry is called Jensen Shannon divergence in which can be done in this equation. About the m is an average of 2 distribution. M. And the kl divergence is very useful in some kind of special kind of machine learning, for example, in the first class, I mentioned some of my work is related to domain adaptation, use that case. That's why we have 2 different domains right. We have source domain, we have time domain, we are more likely to reduce the kl divergence between the two domains so that we can measure them together. Is there like a rule of thumb for the value of the k l divergence that's acceptable? You either have 2 different distributions. Otherwise, it's not useful. Right? For example, you got a credit, let's say, in our typical machine learning, you only have x training sample x here. Right? The inner domain. At that patient, we will have 2 different domains. We have a soft domain or have a type domain. In this case, we really have merged together. Try to reduce the KL divergence. Okay. How's that? How's your question? I was just asking you if you're like a value that you a target value, perhaps, well, you know, that's most give you this kind of number. Definitely, the smaller, better. Right?"

So, cross entropy is the closely related to the KL divergence and it is defined as the summation of the entropy h of p entropy, and the kl divergence is DKL p over q here, and eventually can be rewriting in this way. Automatically, we can write cross entropy in this case, so some of you might see this equation. So, in machine learning, let's assume a classification based on set of data point X1X2 to xm, that needed to be classified into k classes. For each of them, example, xi, we have a past level yi here, which means that your label y model, that you build distribution p here, So the goal is to train a classifier, for example a neural network, a parameter by theta. That outputs are a pretty good class level of i hat, alright, predict the level of y hat for the estimated distribution of q. So, in this case, the cross-entropy loss between the 2-distribution p and the estimate dispersion q is calculating this cross-entropy loss. And nearly, we were trying to minimize them.

But classification problem from previous pages, we want to find parameters theta so that for the data examples x1 to xn the probability of outputting class labels y1 to yn is maximized. Which means that we try to get. There are character levels by using some kind of models. That that you said. For some examples of predictive class and why It have will be different than the true class why I bought the gold is a final theta that resulting in an overall maximum probability. So overall, this is like a very sort of the automatic output in the model, there is there is a promotional truth, this kind of minutes up. It's a probability. And this is the truth based that p1 to pn does not depend on the parameter data, and that we can assume that we have no prior assumption with it, on which set of parameter theta are better than any others.

Using Multinoulli distribution as a probability of predicting true class yI is equal to this 1 is a probability of x over data, product of all of y hat IJ, where j belongs from 1, 2, to the k, can you step in the k clusters here? For example, we have problem with 3 classes car, house, tree, and an image of a car x I, and the true label yi is gonna be 100. Let's assume a predicted label yi hat should be like 0.7, 0.1 and 0.2 then the probability is given by this equation that we should have calculated. Just about to 0.71. So now we can predict the label as which class. Assuming that the data examples are independent the likelihood of the data given the model parameters theta can be written as p of x1 to xn which is the product of the yin. It is the numerical calculations product of many transformations, for example, like this 1, because they really will change this, like, product to, like, summation. So, it should be much easier to calculate your That's the reason why we use a lot of likelihood here. So, it eventually becomes a 2 summation of yi-to-yi hat here. So, are negative, a lot of likelihood. A lot of us minimize our approach is negative, blah blah, so you're measuring. They should be just equal to the but the cross-entropy loss here. So last, the same as the minimize cross entropy. Plus. So here is a bigger problem of it. And now up to now, I believe we already cover All are important to mess back on. I mean, it's all cost. I see here you guys see in some part, and you have a lot of familiar with that."

For example, the salary is able negative 10. Is a wrong data right. And an inconsistent, so contain some discrepancies in the codes on names. For example, age is equal to according to your birthday is equal in this number. Right? For given the people you have different age, you have different birthday right, previously is a rating like a registry. So now someone really is as of ABC. Right? It's different and there are some other discrepancies to duplicate the recall. And even sometimes, there are some intentional mistakes.

And another way maybe we try to fill in the missing various manually, maybe it's some kind of tedious or infeasible. But typically, we may need like, fill in, like, the mean of some missing values. Right? So, fill in it automatically with, a global constant, for example, unknowing a new class, and the attribute mean like that.

Detecting and resolving data value conflicts for the same real-world entity, attribute values from different sources are different possible reasons different representations, different scales, for example metric vs. British units. So next, we want to talk about the data integration. And data integration, so in the best of me is they were trying to combine data from multiple sources, in GI or hand the stores or the schema indication, maybe, for example, you're gonna charge your matches at customer ID that they equal to the e customer ID, so which means that they're integrated from different sources. And the entity identified problem. So, identify, we have real entities from multiple data sources, for example, peer printer is equal to the well-intended. Is that correct? So, detecting some results in some data, very complex. For the 7-megawatt entity, attribute values from different sources are different. Multiple reasons for different representations, different skills. That, for example, the magic combined with some practice units."

If A and B are greater than 0, A and B are positively correlated A values increase as B. The higher, the stronger correlation. And lastly the A and B is equal to 0 if they are independent and product of a and b is less than 0 means they are negatively correlated. Analysis is a flexible move. Just a month, you need to calculate the correlation coefficient that we mention the earlier, right? But also named the Pearson product movement of provisions like the legend in these ways.

There's a reason why we want to reduction of data. There are data reduction methods. For example, wavelet transforms, the PCA, and the feature creation, the feature subset selection. The numerosity reduction. So, regression and log-linear models, the histogram, clustering, the data cube aggregation. So, data compression.

The initial rules like the equal width were missing the equal bucket range. For example, this, which means that it should be the whites of it should be equal. Another way is like equal frequency or equal depths, which you just like as this kind should be equal. So, there's 2 different rules for the partition of it."

Interval labels can be used to replace actual data values. Reduce the data size by discretization. Supervised compared to unsupervised. Splitting top-down versus merge bottom-up. Discretization can be performed recursively on an attribute. Prepare for further analysis. For example, the classification. So, for before your classification, you really need to process the data. For example, convert this kind of video and audio data to some kind of numerical presentation. But eventually, you cannot put text in some kind of model. Right? It should be definitely some numbers."

What about I mean, as and other answers of our participants speaking with question and classification? I think for regression, your predictive target is the numerical data, and for the classification is like your predictive target is. It's not the numerical data. It is the It is the ordinary or the classification data. Is that correct? Yes. Kind off. So, I will answer this question later. So now, let's first tell what is the classification. The classification is really. We want to classify things. Or even with different categories. Like, do a bunch of other images of cat, dog, or other animals, but classification is just 1 possible. Classification. So now let's talk about what are the other differences between regression and classification. For classification, so actually, the output is nominal. This is something you need to remember. And the regression, the output is a very continuous number. There can be any continuous number. Right? But for the classification, there can be just a norm, which means that can be 1, or 2, or 3, or 4. It can be these numbers. Right? It cannot be, but classification cannot be 0.1, 0.2, 0.3. All of our regression, there can be any continuous number. You can see the difference here, what about you? Okay. Good. Other regressions are typically, the easy 1 is just a normal linear regression. It means just y equals to mx plus b. On about the multiple regression, that means just that we have a different regression in mind, different available, in the regression. But about polynomial, polynomial is missing that we have different degrees of regression. Right? As you can see. And about the classification, some methods like classification like k nearest neighbor some decision tree classification, and some random forest classification. So, during the classification, we're really more likely to find this boundary between different classes, right? But it was a regression. We really wanted to figure out data. Right? Just see the difference from the channel. Any questions so far? No? Okay. Let's continue."

Because, in the first homework, some of you gave me very limited answers. It's not enough. Okay? It is too short. It's not a sort of idea. Right? So, now, I really want you to think about your idea about how to change it. For example, in a classification problem, how can you change a regression model to a classification problem?

Which way? You see him this way? Come on? Are you guys agree that? so actually so you guys need to notice that. A linear regression, we act your own freedom that once. We want the data point that at close, not the line is close to the data point. Right? So typically, we are use this as the linear line. That it can now point to right, because it fits a lot of data points, right? And this regression lines that you guys can calculate to fit those datasets. So, let's say, in this case, we can define a threshold, right, was a linear regression, and h theta x here means the output of your need. The theta here means the parameters. So, let's say, for your outputs, it's bigger than 0.5, we are trying to predict it as 1. If not, we were just predicting it as 0 here, but so, let's say here is a threshold 0.5. So which part is negative, and which part is positive. Is this example. Here's the threshold 0.5. Say it loudly. You mean this part is positive? Why it is positive? Do you think this part is positive or negative? It's kind of negative, right? Let's see more details. So, actually, we're using this line as kind of our decision boundary. So, if it is below 0.5 you look this part, it is negative. If it is bigger than 0.5, those parts. So those 4 points, where we will say, it is positive, right. So, in this example, you may think that this linear regression should be a good model, right. Can you realize the purpose of classification? Can you do that for this dataset? Is it a good one? Good one, right? Because it can successfully separate those two different classes, but however, let's see another case."

So let's say we still want to use the previous 0.5 as the threshold. So, what will change? The answer is here. so, if you would fit the best of the regression line. There still won't be enough to decide any point by which we can differentiate classes. It will, put some positive class examples into negative classes. So, in this example, what 10 points will be pushed to the negative? In this case? How many points now? 3, 3 points. Are you guys agree with him? How many points will be pushed to the left? 7 points?

If you say logistic regression if for regression problem. Then we're done with it. But remember about that, logistic regression is really for classification problem. So that we will discuss more about it. It's known as a logistic regression, because its underlying technique is quite the same as linear regression, and the term logistic is taken from the logit function. That is used in this method for classification. What is logit function here? You guys remember? You mean y or you mean x? Y is 0 to 1, why? Okay, so let's say, here is about logit function. So, x is 0 to 1. And Y should be any real numbers, right? Now, what you said is called the sigmoid function. So now you guys notice the differences between logit function and sigmoid function. Did you see it? So, let's say what is the range of the logic function. What is x range? That's 1 in this model. Can you see it? 0 to 1, right. So, what about x range in your sigmoid function? What? Your x is between what for sigmoid function. That's it. The ideal range of x is between what? Connectively even is, which is the positive you use. Right? Because you know why your sigmoid is between 0 and 1, right. Because 0 and 1 is so called the probability, are you notice that. So now you have seen the logit function is kind of opposite for sigmoid function that you guys need to remember. Yeah. Kind of yeah. There has differences between them. Okay. remember about it."

So once let's say we try to predict y is equal to 1. You have to make sure you would like to see z is bigger than 0, because you can see from the plot, right? If it is close to 1, the definitely the z should be bigger than 0, right. If it is negative, so definitely, your z should be less than 0. Can you hear me? Good.

Or should it be the probability of y is equal to 1, and then times with the probability of x, giving y is equal to 1, right. Is it correct? Can I apply the Bayes rule for this one? Let me use. So, what is the Bayes rule of this one? Anyone wants to write the equation for us. Ayush is that you? Go ahead. Write for us. You don't know. Can you remember bayes rule? Maybe you can have it a try. The Bayes rule about this one. Just apply the Bayes rule. And it doesn't matter. Yeah. You can just write. What are you think about the Bayes rule in your mind, regarding this one. We got not crazy about this just about, right. Is this correct? Do you agree with him? No. It should be 1. Can you write for us? The first one? So, we are more likely to use the first one which is so called the Bayes rule for you guys. For those you can't remember it, read again in our previous slide. So, this is the something we will use. So, actually, let's try to compare with those 2 again. So, this is the P x for probability of x given y just this which the denominator is correct, so, what about the denominator? Here is just p x. So, p x is about the probability of x. A probability of x should combine all the probability of y in the 0 and the probability of 1, right. So that is can be subplace in this case. Right? 1 and 0. Right? Right? On this equation. That's not it. So then, next step we need to try to divide by probability of y is equal to 1, and probability of x, given y is equal to 1, we can get this kind of equation, right, when we try to divide it by this one? We get this case right. So, next, we will try to apply the exponential and also about the log n. What does this mean? So, you will get what? So, let's say if the value of x here is equal to 1, the same, right, same as x. So, then we'll try to just apply this case, right, so we have this exponential and the logarithm, part here. So next, we try to separate here, right, with this. What we'll do? That is this part. So then that's the reason why this part the first part, we have said this is the pi, and why this is pi? It's from probability. Right? And then we try to apply all the cases about all I in this case. Right? We still have this model here. Eventually, we will try to, tried to use the probability of x given y, so, that is really about Gaussian function. Right? So, I will not explain too much here. But anyway, so, eventually, those party just means here. And then this party is so-called theta I that we want to mention, and this is eventually why we can get a lot of status here. Right?"

And we have to make it to cost as this equation, so, eventually we can say the cost of h theta x y should be equal to one over 2 and then bra of this. This is from linear regression. Right?"

In this part. h theta x is closer to 0, is closer to 1, and this part is close to what? How to draw this function here. Yeah. Here are two guesses for you guys. This is the first 1, but this 1, second 1 should be in this way. Which might be that the first one or second one? This line or this line. Why you choose? Why? So which 1 is this line? First 1. Are you guys agree with him? Yes, confused. Confused it. Okay. Why confused here. That's say if y is equal to 1, the cost is equal to 0. To be here, right? This is 1. This is y prediction. But this is a prediction, prediction is equal to 1. So, that cost is close to 0. So, then you have 1 point here, but, oppositely, if h of x is close to 0, so that costs to be given it. You have these 2 points. Right? So, then naturally should be the first 1. But is that right? But you have these 2 key points. 1 point here, 1 point here, should be like this. Right. And that's that.

So, why should we do it this way? So, this is first part, why should we time with one. This is the second part. Why? We need to use the one minus y here. And guess, why do we want to use this one minus? Cause this is we want to match any positive number. Right? After applying this you should get positive. Right? So eventually, it will give you reduced cost function, right? We should use the negative. That's the reason why we use one minus to be here, so, eventually form the overall cost function. So, let's say the y is equal to 1. This the equation is equal to what. Y is 1. This is part. But you got it by. So, you should use negative log h theta x. If the y is equal to 0, so, that definitely is the second part. Right? So, we will get the negative log one minus theta x. So, it should be the same as the previous one.

Let's say why y is equal to here. Any guess, any reasons? Why the probability of y given x is equal to here? You should notice what about the y. The y, we have how many we just have 0 and 1.

H theta x is the same for linear regression and logistic regression? Are the same here? What is the h theta of x for the linear regression? Why is it equal to what say again? It's a linear line. It's a mathematics, so, you say. It is more like w x plus b, that is the h theta x. What about the h theta in logistic regression? Can you remember, we just mentioned? Exactly. That is the sigmoid function. So, that's the reason the key difference is in h theta x. H theta function previously, it's just about linear equation, but in this case, it is really about a sigmoid function. So, in this case, the teacher can pause people to watch. That Yes. So, theta t, so it combines both the weight and the bias here. Right? So, that would be called the theta T. But always remember, in the first dimension, we have bias. And this is function for the logistic regression. So, this is the key difference between linear regression and the logistic regression during the gradient descent. In which part? Alpha. Yes.

For the y, if y is equal to 1, it should be negative log h theta of x and y is equal to 0, they should be negative log one minus h theta x here. And what about the gradient descent? You guys need to remember we use after alpha should be 1 over m this sum h theta x minus y then times with x j i here. That's about the regularization. Remember with the additional what. For the addition what we can get it. Right. Yes. For the addition prior, so, that we can get this kind of equation. The alpha, lambda, theta j is really about another penalty here.

So, previously you guys just call function from scikit learn. But in this case, you guys need to implement by yourself. And here are the details that you guys can look for. So, first of all, it's about standardization. So, this mu is about what. It's about the normalization of the data. Right? This one is easy. The next thing is initializing of your parameters. You will have a feature vector that is size m by n and plus one. Why it plus one? All is a feature vector; you have m times n plus 1. Why is this plus 1? And also, you have weights, kind of weights, or theta here, n plus 1 times 1. Why is n plus 1? This is the ambient number of points, and the n here is the number of observations or number of features in each point, right, so, why is n plus 1? Yes. So, that is a bias. So, you guys need to remember once you try to implement it, you should make sure the dimensionality. I'll say you have n plus 1. Keep in mind. And next, you needed to implement the sigmoid functions should be very easy. Right? But this is the thing that you guys need to remember that is about the dot product of this feature vector, and the weight here. Next step, you guys need to define a function of the cost function. So, this is the cost function that you guys need to define in your homework. Next step is really about the gradient descent. Right? The gradient descent, this is the key part, right?"

And then this is the key part why how can you finish the gradient descent? Is really about repeat. The number of iterations that you guys need to define. Right? And for each xi, probably, you can skip this part, but you need to definitely calculate what is the estimate output. You'll have a function f, right? h theta x need to calculate about output that is y hat. Y hat is the prediction of your. Y hat is the prediction of what? Of your logistic regression model, right? And after that, you can calculate a loss. The loss will tell you how far of y hat i and output here, right? So, next, you really, you need to use this how you should move the theta to maximize the loss.

To be honest, it's not always this, not always this. You can it's better if you use this, but sometimes you have a very strange dataset. You need to standardize the dataset. But it is not necessary for this part. This is something I want you guys to keep in mind. Given in the future, you guys need to use normalization of your data. That's good. Yeah.

So, for that regularization, we're really to want to avoid over-fitting problem. For regularization, you will add another penalty, right? In gradient descent part, you will make it smoother and avoid to give over-fitting of it. That's the one advantage. And another thing is about the dataset, the dataset. If you just have a few datasets, it will be very easy to decrease gradient descent. So, in that case, the regularization should be another option.

You'll find the least square's estimates we differentiate S. Alpha beta with respect to alpha and beta respectively. Right? That we will set the derivatives is equal to 0. Is it the correct way? okay. So then, if let's say, let's check that derivative with alpha with respect to here. Take the directive about S with respect to alpha. What can we get here? Take a piece of paper out. You need to find equations now. You have paper in hand you can try to calculate. If you do not have a paper, we have blackboard. Who do not have paper here? Oh, Now, who want to do it for us? This part should be very easy. Right? Should I call name? Raise your hand. Go ahead, do it for us. Please respect to alpha. Just respect to alpha. This one. This S. Square also. Square. Yes. This is square. This is sigma i to n, yi minus alpha minus beta xi and then square. That's it. You miss this one. So, this is the overall S here then you check the derivative with alpha. Any of you already have answers? No. No answer? You have answer? Do you write down? No? Okay. No worries. You should be first. Let's do what's going on. Yeah. It's fine. Yes. And also, do you have answer? Just a respect to alpha. Okay. Let's see. Do you have answer? No. It doesn't matter. There has 2 here. Right? It has the square here. Right? Once you have this kind of problem, you probably will move this 2 to be here in the front. Then you will copy this, right, then do a derivative with this to alpha again. Right? Yeah, move two to the front, then copy this one here. Yes. Yes. Continue. Yes. This is the 2. Yeah. Yeah. Copy it again. Copy this full equation, and then you will time with another derivative that is respect to alpha. Yeah. So, now alpha should be negative 1, right, so, you'll can pull negative 1 in the front. Right? Yeah. it should be no. but the xi it should put there. Right? Yeah, the combination of xi was those right. It's about but it doesn't matter. I understand your part. Yeah. Go ahead. Yeah. It's fine. You guys get an answer? Let me check if you guys have. Oh, yes. How about you? Do you have answer here? Seems correct. Now let's say more details about alpha here. So, first, this is just very easy about this. This one, once you try to take respective with alpha, you will put the 2 in this front right? You can see you put the 2 to the front then you copy of this equation. So, then, the second one you check the derivative in the inside is negative one, right? So, you will have negative 2 here. So, now, because we need to set it to 0, so here the negative 2 is gone. Right? This is really about the first one. Right? Does that make sense? That part? In the second part? Let's really do it closely. So, the key things are what? The key thing is about the square here. The 2 here. Right? The first one, your first part you should get this 2. That is fine. sigma from i to n then you will have yi minus alpha then minus beta xi here. This is your first part, right. The second part will take derivative respect to alpha. The inside should be negative. Is respective to the alpha to be negative 1. Once you try to set them into zero, you can cancel this negative 2. This is the key thing that eventually we have this part. What about the respective to. Let's try to expand this first. What is the answer for this one? Once you try to expand those. What will you get? Show us, what\u2019s the answer for this one? Try to expand this. What can you get in this equation equal to zero? Can you come to write for us? For this one, what can you get? Now you really notice that although you guys have the kind of background. Once when you calculate, kind of confusing, right? And this the key things and very normal machine learning course and practice. This one? Can you pull the n to here? Yeah, make it better. Yes. Yes. Is it correct? This one is right. Let's look into details. The detail is n alpha here. Why you have n? The sum of alpha. So, you will have n alpha here. Good right, do you get it? What about the second one? The second one. What is the difference about the second one? Second one is what? Write for us for the second one. Which is with respect to the beta. What is the answer for the beta? It is just times with sigma of xi. Get it? No matter you can do it. No matter how, you can do it for us. Where is the alpha come from? This is two, sorry. Sorry it's two, okay. So, now, next you need to take it respective to the beta. Yes. What is the answer for this part? To the beta? This is zero. Yes. What about this part? This should be just xi. We will keep the summation here. So, eventually, should be just xi in the right. Right. You guys understand it? Okay, good. Go back, so, now, this finally get this one. The only difference is that the additional xi here that is equal to zero. So, once you try to expand those one, you will get this equation, right? Next with the most important part for you guys is how to solve this alpha and beta here."

Write down, I will check each of you to get something solution. You don't need to cancel alpha. For example, if you want to calculate the beta, you need to cancel this alpha. Right? To cancel the alpha out, For the first 1, what do you need to do? You first need to divide by n. So, then cancel this part, right? So, then you can cancel this alpha alright. The first equation divided by n, then times with this part. Go ahead. Can move them together. Most of this n to be there. move the n to this part and this part. Just one over n here, one over n, one over n right here. Okay. So, now go ahead. Then times with this part. No. This equation, you still need to times with. You can check that, but it's fine.

Should be times with n here times with it here. There should be equal. Right? Is this correct? Yes. What about if we have beta here. How can you get alpha? Is it easy to get alpha?

So, the i-th residual ri is defined as a vertical distance between the i-th point and the estimated regression line. So, for example, this should be yi minus alpha hat minus beta hat xi. Why it has that hat here? What does this hat mean for this kind of? It should be estimated parameters. So, that we had hat here. And this is so-called the residual that we can get from the model. But always you needed to remember that sum of all residues should be equal to 0. Is that true?"

Let's try to go back to this equation. So, the answer is what alpha should be, no the beta should be negative 0.25. It should be good. And this one should be 2.35. Right? Now, this is the number. You guys can remember, right. Always try to be patient. Even for this, it's so simple calculation. Most student can do it, you see, you still can get something wrong. Right? So, always keep in mind.

So that increasing the number of features will not always improve the classification accuracy. As you probably can see in this plot. This is the number of dimensionalities of your features. And as here is about your performance. So, in practice, that inclusion of more features, might not, might actually have worse performance. As you can see, once we try to achieve this point, your performance is actually going down. Right? The number of training examples required increases exponentially with the dimensionality of d, that is about the k power of d here. So, here, k is just the number of bins your features. So, for example, in this case, we have 3 bins, and then if it is 2 d, it should be like a 3 with a power of 2. If it is in the 3 dimensions, so, then we get a 3 with the power of 3. So eventually, those should be exponential with the k with the power of these. Now, we have noticed that it really requires lots of dimensions. Right?

So, for example, here you have x. The x consists of a bunch of points from x1, x2 to xN. So, once you try to apply some function, let's say, f(x) here, you get the y. So why should it be from y1, y2 to yK? In this case, your K should be way smaller than N, and this is one method that so-called the feature extraction. So, this is a feature map the mapping function f() would be linear or nonlinear. So, for example, if your x is just an image, right? You can think about your f(x) as a neural network. So, typically, the neural network is a nonlinear function. Right? So, then, you can project your data to like a one full dimension. For example, if you will have 1000 classes, there should be 1000 dimensions. Right? For feature selection, it ends to chooses a subset of the original features. Given this example from x1 to xN similar as before, right, we have this x. So, once you perform the feature selection. So differently, in this case, your y should be what? It's kind of. Now, you should compare the difference between x and y. So now you all deserve that. Your y just a subset of your x, right? So, this is so-called the feature selection. You will choose the first K features here. You will think they are important. So, that's the reason you want to keep the first K, our top K features here."

He told me that he gives you guys a project related to it. We can Hey. So, you guys did implement. Right? Yeah. Okay. So, did you familiar with those steps? Yes. Yes. Yes, or no? Okay. Let's try to review about it. So first, our goal is what? our goal is try to find the r-dimensional projection that best preserves the variance. The first step, you try to calculate the mean. next one you need to calculate covariance matrix, sigma of original points. They should be easy right? So next, all the most important step is tried to compute the eigenvectors or eigenvalues of sigma. So then, the third step is to try to select the top r eigenvectors. And of course, that way, if you want to reduce dimensionality, you need to project a point into some subspace expanded by them. So, this y as your new point or as your reduced dimensions. y is it equal to A, A is what? A is the reduced eigenvectors. You can select the top k of this A, it's just some rows of your eigenvectors. And the mu here is just about the mean here. So now you guys should maybe you can remember a little bit about the PCA, the steps."

So, you'll have a square matrix A. So, you have x, x here means eigenvectors. Right? Lambda here is just. Sorry. It should be just what? The x just should be the eigenvectors, and the lambda should be eigenvalues, the in this case. As a 0 vector cannot be an eigenvector, and the 0, 0 can be an eigenvalue. Why? So, giving an example in here. This is the example. This lambda is eigenvalues. Right? Can this be 0? No. Why not. Because it holds some value and it cannot be input. Any other have the different answer? So, x here is eigenvector. Right? It is vectors. And then A is just a matrix. For example, this is like this can be 2 by 2, and then this can be in 2 by 1, So, eventually, this should be sorry, this should be 1 by 2, and this can be 2 by 1. Eventually, can you get a 0? Yes, or no? So, let's say A the matrix. That's no. In this case, it should be just a square metric. It shouldn't be shouldn't be 1 by 1. But, again, eventually, can you have a case that lambda is equal to 0. Is that possible? This is a 2 by 2. This is also a 2 by 2 vector. Can you eventually get a vector with all zeros? No. I think you guys are confused. Right? Let's say, A here is the matrix. So, this is A. Ix that he gives you the lambda ax. So, as let's say, it has the matrix size of 2 by 2. 2 by 2, this x, and we also like to 2 by 2. This 2 by 2 matrix by some numbers here, 2 by 2, 2 by 2, 2 by 2. So, lambda here, that's it's also 2 by 2. Is that possible that lambda can be equal to zero? Is that possible? No. No? Why says no. Even this is equal 0, it reduces all examples can be zero. Is that possible? Eventually, these products are equal to zero. Is that true? No matter what is number you're starting it. Eventually, you can get all zeros. Right? Is that possible? the product all that can be 0? No way? It's gonna be a long you in the first example is it possible to be zero? Is that possible? It's possible. Right? Why now, this is just for different numbers. Definitely, it should be, let's say, this minus 2, this 2, this should be 1. What's the number here? What is first number here? There is 0, right, is that possible? It's possible, right? Significantly, for the other answers, you can have all the zeros in this case. Right? Which means that your lambda can be zeros, right?

Is zip 2, life for your guys. Can you see this example? No. We can't see that. You cannot see it? That doesn't matter. it's just a that's too bad. Maybe next time I can write here, maybe better. But anyway, in this case, you guys can try to prove whether this x is the eigenvector for A here. Do you complete? Yeah. Can you write answer here for us? 2 eigenvectors for this. Can you write down your answer how to get this? On professor, we can see your next slide in our screen. Really? You see the next slide? Yes. That's too bad. You guys get some answers there. How about now. Can you see? Still, because I think it is, like, a note to show the speakers. So, it\u2019s good now. Let me do it again. How about now? Oh, yes. That that that's the regular. Okay. Okay. That's good. You got it that? Basically. What I mean here so here is x. Right? Yeah. You should have. A too here and 1 to there. Yeah. It should be it should be like a. Is the same? It seems not the same. You should be. There's gotta be another way to do that. You can do that here. It's better. Let's see what's the solution here okay. You guys get it? If you don't get it, let's see the answer hear. So first, let's get Ax. So, what is Ax here. So, you have A as this matrix 2, 2 by 2. Right? You have this x as 2 by 1. So, you eventually get a matrix size of 2 by 1. Right? So now, what is the answer for this one? Ax, you get all zeros. As an example, I explained previously, you get all zeros. So, in this case, where is lambda? Lambda should be equal to 0. So that you can satisfy, you get all zeros. Right? As I depend, this is the reason why lambda can be 0, but you are eigenvectors cannot be 0. So, in this case, definitely, your x to e is equal to 2 1 should be eigenvector for your matrix, right? So, guys, guys get this part, right. Awesome."

So, for example, we move the lambda x to the left side, you get this 0, so then we'll put the x out so that we get x minus with the lambda, I, then comes with x equal to 0. So eventually, let's try to say, if we can define a matrix B, Let's say, if B is equal to A minus lambda I here, so in this case, you can get another new equation that is BX equal to 0. Some of you may catch that. If B has an inverse, which means that x is equal to B inverse with 0. That is equal to 0, right? Is that correct? Is this correct? From here to here. It's correct, right. So that box, the vectors cannot be 0. Right? So, in this case. So, therefore, we can get another kind of draw form there. So, x will be an eigenvector of A, if and only if B does not have any inverse, or equivalently det B is equal to 0. What is det here? The determinator of B, yeah, is equal to 0. All you can write in here, you needed to calculate a determinant of A minus lambda I, I is what? eigenvalues. Yes. Correct. It should be equal to 0."

Now, I needed someone give me some answers to me. So, calculate this, and tell me what are the eigenvalues you got it here. Let's try to test it yourself whether you really can calculate these simple eigenvalues. Anyone get some answer here? What is yours? 1, 2. Okay. You have 1, 2. What about others? I have -1 and -2. You have -1 and -2. You have all of these results that Yujie got. Let's see which one is correct. Did anyone of you get? -1 and -2, okay. Are you sure your answer is correct? That's saying the answer is from other students. If that so difficult for this answer? Juju. Did you get some results? I got Manus 1 and Manus 2. Manus 1. How about others how about Ming-How. Do you get some answers here? -1 and -2. Okay. I guess, majority of all, guys are getting some answer, let's see which one is correct. Oh, now, from here. So, definitely, it could be -1 and -2, right. Did you get something right here? So now it's just like a lambda 1 minus 2 times lambda plus 5, and it should be plus 12, right? There should be that. So, eventually, it should be equal to 0, we get -1, -2 here. So now I see you guys already get the key part about the eigenvalues. So actually, note that. The roots of the characteristic equation can be repeated. That is lambda 1 is equal to lambda 2 to lambda k. If that happens, the eigenvalue is said to be of multiplicity k here. And then here is another example. let's try, like is a little bit difficult for you guys. What about those, what about this answer? This 1. Do you remember how you calculated the determinant of the matrix size of 3 by 3? Really? Can you remember? Can you see it? This is how come that it is? Can you say, what about in this case? What is the number? Can you remember? What is the first one? That's kinda little bit of challenging for you guys, but that's the matter. I put it here. For you guys, this is 3 by 3 determinator, right? So, this is gonna be everything you need to calculate. And this is extremely easy example to get it. So, what's your answer in this case? And this is the way how you calculate it. You get it? Pinxue, do you get it? No. Why? It seems you are confused. You have any questions? No. What's your answer here? What's this? Yeah. If you have a question, just ask. Can you understand those? You know? Know this, this is how you calculate to determinator of matrix size 3 by 3. Right. So, what's your answer for this case? For this example? It's what? It's 8. It's 8. How you calculate the 8 if I've already given you this one? What's the answer here? What is A here? So here is this, you need to through this equation. Write down, write this equation first. What is lambda I minus A, write down this one first. Go ahead. Go to the blackboard and show us about how to calculate this one. Go ahead, yeah, show us. This is really important for you guys to understand. Yeah here, write down. Yes. Exactly. Do you guys get it? It should be easy right. It's just eventually you get lambda that is. Lambda one equal to lambda 3 is equal to lambda 3. You got just 2 here. Right. For our online students, do you have some questions? No? Yes, or no? No questions. Okay. Good. Let's continue."

So that example you guys maybe no more how you calculate eigenvalues. And then we will discuss more about how to get this step-in detail. In this case, that is, say, as a sigma x the ui is equal to lambda i, ui, sometimes where we assume lambda 1 is bigger than lambda 2 is bigger than lambda N and eventually. We needed to notice that. For most software packages, it returns the eigenvalues or corresponding eigenvectors is in decreasing order. So, if not, you can explicitly put them in this order. Remember, you need to put them in this order. Okay. If you if it is in different order, you will do not correct. Remember about that. Since, sigma x is symmetric, that u1 to uN form an orthogonal basis in the real values of N dimensions, and we can represent any matrix x here use this kind of equation. So that is x minus x bar. So, this is previously the standard data. Right? That is can be donated from the using the sum of yiui. So eventually, it should be y1u1 plus y2u2 plus to yNuN here, right, uN here. And the yi can also calculate it in this one. And this is just a change of basis. So that we said, is the u1, u2, to uN is form an orthogonal basis in the real values of N dimension matrix. And the similarly you can see in this case. And also, you need to notice that most software packages, the normalize of the ui here to unit length to simplify the calculation, if not, you can normalize by yourself. Do know how to normalize a vector? A vector. How you can normalize a vector. Mobile has been doing this next way and the subtract. Really? Are you sure you say something correctly? how you get the? How you normalize this data? Just use this phase. Because you need to normalize into unit length, and that's just equal to 1, equal to 1. How to do that? Each value of the vector needs to in square. And the square button. It should be a vector divided by its norm. Right? It's just for example, for vector v, you get a unit length, v divided by a norm of v, right? That's it. But the norm of v is calculated like you said you square those and sum of each number, right?"

That is what you said. The corresponding to the k largest eigenvalues where k is a parameter. As you have seen so previously, this is expected in the equation that we donate this data set. Right? So, let's say, if we want to get the less dimensions, so eventually, we will choose the first k dimensions. For example, they eventually, this data x can be reconstructed by using y1u1 plus y2u2 until we get an ykuk, right? So, this is so-called the K. Top k eigenvectors. And then eventually, this is similar. This is a previous data set, and then eventually you can represent this data set to use previously, it is y, y1 to yN, so now you get the y1 to yK here. So, this is about dimensionality reduction step. This is another way to realize to reduce about your data set. If let's say K is equal to N, what does this mean? It means that you are reconstruct the x data set, is equal to your original data set. And means further, it implies that there's 0 recognition error, right? Because your reconstruction data is exactly same before. But typically, we not required to use this. We do not value you get results that K is equal to N, which means you do nothing. Right?"

And eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis that is u here is previous as similar previously. And eigenvalues decomposition of x the transpose that is equal to this equation, whereas U can see the loss of u1, u2 to uM, and the sigma here is just equal to the diagonal of this lambda 1, lambda 2, to lambda M here.

For example, in this case, the u1 should be the largest one, and u2 should be the second largest one, right? As I said previously, because the PCA preserves as much information as in data. Preserving as much variance in the data set. So here, u1 and u2. You can try to preservative it so that you can get a lot of information about data set."

This result has this one, and this is better in a normalized data set. So, 1 here. And this is about your second eigenvalue, right?

So, in this case, once you try to expand this one, it should be 2.92 times with X1 plus 3.67 times with X2, then equal to 8.22 X1 right. So eventually, you get two equations. So based on those, our first can get this one, is this part. And from second one you get this one. So, then, what is your X1 X2 here? Can you give me an example of the X1 and X2? Write down your X1 X2 here. Write down. Write down for your answer. Give me a give me X1 and X2. Yeah. It doesn't matter. Thank you. Give us 1, you think, and you want to give us one you think, and you want to give us. This is your X1 is equal to 3. This is your one guess. Do you have another guess? Based on this one. So, this is the first equation I get. What about those, the second equation? Is that correct? Is this one correct based these two equations. Is that correct? You can get those two. Right? But eventually, those should be very similar to each other. Right? Can you calculate the norm of it? Calculate the norm of this vector. Tell me what is your unit length of it? So, this is really about the eigenvectors. This is true. Right? You can use a computer, just use Python. Just to put this array then divide by its norm. Right. And tell me when this your answer is from these two, are similar, or the same, or something else? You can write down the norm for these two. You get it? Yeah. What's that? You can write it down there. Bring your laptop to there. Let's see what is your answer. It's the same. Same? You see it? You got you got calculated? What is the output here? What is the norm of this? Do you calculate? Is that same? Yeah. What are these mean? Although, you get two eigenvectors. Are they similar? Are they the same? Are they similar? Right. So eventually, if you calculate the norm, you should be very similar to each other. Is that correct? Right? Although you see these two are different, but once you get the norm of it, divided by norm, you will get similar stuff. And here is one answer that is just from this first equation, you can get X1 that is equal to 0.69 X2, and from two you get eigen vectors. This is one answer that Yujie write here. This is correct, right? And eventually, so now, up to now, you say you can calculate eigenvectors, right. You get it? Good. And this is also called the first component, right?

And then, if you calculate the, if you are interested, you can go back and calculate the second vector. So, second eigenvalue, right? eigenvalue. So, second eigenvalue is 0.38. So, you can get the second direction so that it should be perpendicular to this one line, it should be just very short. Let's do this. So, I think, up to now, you guys already able to calculate eigen values and eigen vectors, right? No problems at all. So that in the future, if your interview asks you how to calculate eigen values and eigen vectors, are you guys able to answer that? Maybe, for example, tell me the steps you can get calculated the PCA. You guys should notice about that. And this should be 1 interview question for you guys."

So that based on the eigenvectors, the previous equation, can you project into 1 dimension? Can you do that right now? What is the projection of 2 1? So, if you care about, you'll calculate reduction, right? Previously we get the first and second eigenvectors. The majority focus on the first eigenvector. What is the projection of 2 1 here? Can you calculate that? So here is the detailed equation. But the feature vector has the transform that if this is the eigenvector. Where are eigenvectors? This is the eigenvector. Use this 1, then times the feature vector. What is the feature vector? feature vector is what? It's 2, 1, right? What is the mean vector? Is 4.55, right? You guys have already calculated it. Then, tell me what is reduced dimensions. What is that number? Your first dimension? Any guess? So, calculate and tell me, what is the reduced dimensions here? Does anyone get the answer here? How about our online students? Do you get some answers here? So, your eigenvectors are here, 2.55 and 3.67. And here is about you really need to calculate it. Heider. Do you get it? No? Yes, or no? Do you know how to calculate it? So, what is the final answer here? No. No, answer. There should be a transpose here. Transpose is eigenvector. There should be a transpose. This is your eigenvector. Right? Transpose of it should be one by two. Ans this is two by one. And you eventually got a number of 1 by 1. That is what. Did you get it? Did you get the answer? What's this? You think the number is minus 6 or something? What about our online students? Did you get some answers here? I got -6.375 and -4. I think it's only one answer, right? Yes. -6 something okay. Get similar. What about other students? Got it? NO. Let's see what's going on of this one, okay. Unfortunately, you guys did not get it correctly. Let's see what's going on. So, this is about the eigenvalue. Right? eigenvector, right, is transposed should be this one This should be first one 2,1, then just minus this mean, right? So eventually, why you guys get minus 6. Which part is not correct? Because this, ShengHan, which part did you get it wrong? Uh-huh. I did not I did not use the dot product. I use multiply it. Sorry. Okay. That's probably the reason. So now you guys notice that how you reduce 2 dimensions to first dimension. Right? And the similarly, if in the homework, just in the homework, I give you some n dimension, and I ask you to reduce into 2 dimensions. You should have got a similar use similar equation, right? You know how to do that right. So, eventually, if you are in your feature size, a vector of dataset X with size of like n by like, 1000, you should reduce the dimension to n times two using the same equation here. You guys get it, right? So now I see here we have finished every step, 5 steps of PCA. Do you guys have any questions so far? Minghow, do you get it? It seems you are confused. Which part of it? Is this part? Did you get this part? Yes. You got it. What about previous eigenvectors? Did you get this eigenvector? You get it right. So, then it's fine. You get an eigenvector. You know about eigenvalues. Then you know how to get these reduced dimensions, then that's it. You know about PCA."

So, this is the t here, where t is the threshold. For example, let's say, if the threshold is bigger than 0.9, that is t is equal to 0.9.

So, this will be significantly slow and there are lots of storage that are required for your computer. But very few 10000-dimensional vectors are valid face images or usable, fast images.

It can achieve maximum like 90 percent a 95 percent of accuracy, but it uses another model that I developed it can achieve 99, almost 100 percent is PGA model, but it's another -- just another application. That is related to this PCA stuff. And this PCA actually is very important in the early stages before emerge deep neural networks, because it's very useful to reduce dimensionality. But nowadays, because we already have different neural networks, we usually use the autoencoder. You guys notice about that, heard about that? Autoencoder. No. Autoencoder. Have you heard about that? That doesn't matter. So, this is just one kind of neural network that is able to reduce dimensionality. Your first have kind of encoder here. An encoder is that you try to reduce dimension for the like the view of encoder. That's all. So, this is called encoder. This is the encoder, which means for example, you can see those images, you know, those images. So, the output of this is latent space. If you get latent space, you really get a small dimension. For example, you have, capital d dimensions, so this space to be small in dimension. And then you have like a decoder here. Make your dimensions go back to original D. So that you can really calculate the error between them, right. For example, here is original image I after this decoder, you can get another image I', right. So that you can calculate the loss that is I minus I' here. By minimizing the loss, you can optimize this network here. And this network is so-called autoencoder. And this is nowadays. People use autoencoder to reduce dimensionality. And typically, the autoencoder can give us a better result than this PCA. So, this is nowadays, we use this kind of method. Hopefully, guys, we are using that later, and you will see about it."

So, eventually, you have this transpose t, here, this is also our u previously, we have t, and then we have alpha, but now we have the K here. K is so-called kernel in this case. Again, we do not need to calculate the Xi here. So, let K dominate Kij is equal to this phi x and the phi xj. Right. So eventually, you can use a portion to represent this phi here. Right? So that in this case, we really have a kernel in this case, in this example. And notice that, that should be centered in the feature space, and this is just the for the easy to donate so eventually should be minus all the mean here. Right? And this is so-called kernel PCA. The kernel PCA, the key reason is that we want sometimes we have, like, complex dataset with high dimensions. If we want to project in the low dimensions, for example, from, like, 2 d to 1 d or 3 d to 2 d, we probably want to use this PCA, kernel PCA. Cause kernel PCA give you a very good way, if the dataset has some strange structure. You will find it is very useful to use kernel PCA. And you guys maybe a little bit confused."

And the researcher's a prior assuming is that any indicator may be associated with any factors and blah blah. That is the most common form of factor analysis. Now there is no prior theory. One uses factor loading to discern the factor structure of the data. A second types is called the confirmatory factor analysis is also called the CFA seeks to determine if the number of factors and the loadings of observed variables on them conform to what is expected on the basis of pre-established theory. A minimum requirement of CFA is that one hypothesize beforehand the number of factors in the model. Here is just some explanation of 2 different models.

The transition problem, that is to transfer the table into a bigger user by moving metrics. So, here, let's look at the details of these metrics. You see so called the weighted metrics. Basically, each goal is a different user here, and the access will be presented in a different movement. And you look at how this some kind spots and reading metrics. Right? So, sometimes, for this person, he or she already likes to attend with this movie history, but I want now they're moving and that it has a lot of personal minds, which means that no data, no reading there, So that easiest canal, sparse reading metrics. As I said, our database is really about the user and the movie as part of that matrix. And our task, we try to find the missing data. For example, for recommending new movies to users failing in the question remarks. And there's also question remarks in grade or moment to figure out. Right? For an injured person, right? For example, for this person that comes to a cat, what can I wait Should be here, you know? And there are lots of algorithms. Like, for example, list of quire method, gradient descent, non-negative matrix factorization, low matrix completion, PCA, SVD, etcetera. So then, into this lecture, we'll be talking more about schema and algorithms. How can it help us to solve those kinds of matrices, completion problem. That's providing some unknown area of arrival. So, this is the reason why plan is the matrix factorization is important."

When we apply SVD, we have X equal to U times Sigma times V^T, where V^T signifies the transpose. The singular values are crucial here. I noticed your point about adding values, U, V, and the chest post. So, without going into too much detail, we can assume that the singular values decrease in order. In other words, Sigma 1 is greater than Sigma 2, which is greater than Sigma. And again, this should be clear in your mind. I'm not entirely sure, but it may result in a more significant metric for a single manifold. If we want to calculate the third largest eigenvalue of your X, it's basically about the trace of the transpose multiplied by X itself. So, in the end, it all comes down to the diagonal elements and their powers, right?"

We want to find some meaning of it. So next, let's try to give up a nation here. So, giving a matrix a, as a size of m by n, we're going to get an m approximation that is almost equal to the same time it was you, with some matrix c, which has a size of m by k, and the u has a size of k by n, have the columns up here."

So given this signal as before, we want to compute another approximation that it has equal to CUR either for some matrix, C, U, and R. But in this case, u has a size of k by k, and R has a size of k by n. So, this is a little bit closer to the SVD. Right? Because as we do, you have new SIGMA and there's a VT here, right, that has a similar matrix as dimensions.

So generally, the first we want to make sure that inter-cluster similarity is maximized, which means that we want to try to distinguish between different clusters, right? For example, we have 2 clusters here. We want the distance between these different 2 clusters to be separated with each other. Right? At the same time, we also want to achieve the goal of the intra class inter-cluster similarity is minimized. Which means that, if we only focus on one class, like one class here, right? There should be all those datasets should be a concentrated with each other right, as you can see here. In this example. These two clusters, each of them has nearby points, are closer to each other. This is the goal that we want to achieve. So later we will try to define the definition of a similarity in matter. Right? So, what is the similarity we want to get here?"

But anyway, those people are in family. But for others, there can be some school employees. And another 1, as that you guys mentioned, we can use the males and females. So now, you may know is that the clustering has a subjective role. There are different ways that you can try to do our correct clustering Either way, you cannot say they are wrong.

What do you think about this? Now, why is this by looking at objections to the sequel? The suggestion here is to give me that you find something to say whether that's enough or not. Hands on the other possible programs. What? Hence on the other possible programs. Yes, which means that eventually, if we just focus on this example, you're starting to see about all other examples. Maybe you find several examples you tell me whether this is similar or not. This is another about the text, the similarity between the different texts, like we have, different Peter and Piotr. Right? And this is how measures similarity here, and also, you'll have this fingerprint, right? And this seems very similar to each other. Because either giving you a very high value here. Questions?"

And definitely, this part is called the internal branch. And this big 1 is called the terminal branch. The similarity between the 2 objects in the Dendrogram is represented as a height up to the lowest, the internal nodes they share. What does this mean? The similarity between the objects.

So typically, it's very easy to find that these 2 clusters are separated with a chance of running, especially for this kind of background. You've got these 2, you have these 2 clusters. And then the surprise -- surprisingly, you have another point is that it's a way. From away from them. It is away from all the other parts. So, this is a single isolated branch. It's suggested that a data point that is very different from all hours prior. It means that in the future, you may think about this can be a way that can help you throw away all different outliers. Typically, if you are the machine learning, we engage with those different outliers, because either way it significantly affects your final results."

So, in this method, the distance between 2 clusters is determined by the distance of 2 closest objects, Also, this is called nearest neighbor. So, this is about a single linkage. The second 1 is about complete linkage. That is the furthest neighbor. So, is this measurable the distance between clusters is determined by, like, great the distance between any 2 objects in the different clusters. That is to say by the furthest neighbors. So, we are kind of focused on the objects that are far away from each other. The last 1 here is about the group average linkage.

        "value": "And also, this is very important about our partition algorithms also called as K means clustering. Your first step is to decide a value for k as a determinant, how many k you want to get. And then next time, you try to initialize the k cluster of centers, randomly, if necessary. And then typically, another way is that sometimes it will be better if we choose a data point, we cannot data point. For example, if k is equal to 3, you can randomly pick up 3 data points, because if you randomly select center, those random points can be far away from your data point. We'll get a, what I'm saying. yes or no. Let me repeat again. So, sometimes it is better if you're, in neutralizing your center using some data points to sell. Is there instead of completely randomly generated points? Because sometimes, if you randomly generate those centers, it will be far away from the data point. If the centers are far away from the point. What is the outcome of it? Whatever your high has a white pen out of high. What about you actually? If your initialization is a problem from your data fine. So now the cumulative thing is that if you run the randomly selected points that are probably from your data points. Eventually, it will take you more time to train this whole algorithm, right, because, in visualization, it is far away from another point. Eventually, you're about to go back a little bit, a little bit like you're still there. Eventually, we'll go back. I think it will affect the speed in terms of convergence. But later you guys can try. Firstly, randomly initialize the clusters, or you can choose some data points. Okay? In the second step, you needed to decide the class membership of n objects by assigning them to the nearest class center. What does this mean, Decide the cross membership of n objects by assigning them to the nearest across the center. Well, it shows their neighbors who will be in the same class. In this case, at least that, you will you will need to assign your data point to its nearby center. Right? previously, you're like, in a second step let\u2019s say, k is equal to 3. Right? You already have 3 clusters, but as they used. 5, do 3. So now, in that state, you'll probably have lots of other data points, lots of dots, right, lots of problems here. In your third step, what you need to do is try to assign the data point through each nearby center. You will get nearby here. It will be up to here. Right? Like, this way. This is the sort of sample. So, you need to calculate a distance. Alright. Calculate. Distance. So, for 1 data point, you needed to calculate. So, in times, yes, exactly. So, then, you were determined, which is its nearby cross turn? What does this mean? Give me just an example. After you add more points in one cluster and you populate the center again. Yes. For example, you have you have assigned those different data points with your cluster. So, in this case, you will try to get the mean of it as its center. You will have this as the original center and, in this case, in the first step, you have a new center. You will move this probably maybe towards here. Right? So, this is how you update your center in this case. It's clear. Right? And in the last step, if none of the n objects has changed the membership in the last iteration, we've tried to exit, and then you're finished. Otherwise, you go to the third step again, right? You are repeated. This is sort of standard. Calculate the distance of this new center. So, this is the previous center. Right? So that is it. This is your new center here; you say that it's none of these n objects are not changing. You can say that you are finished. So, this is about the overall k means clustering method. Is it difficult? Okay. That's great."

So typically, no. So, for that case, either it will maintain as a previous 1, there will be similar to the previous 1, which means none of those objects are changing. Right, but you're only terminating if the center doesn't change. Right? 1 of the standard. It's about the objects. So, no objects. Membership has not changed.

So, I'll just try to briefly mention about k-means clustering methods. It's typically what we're talking about is advantages, and its disadvantages, for example, there are several spaces like relatively efficient. For example, it shouldn't be in the ordinary of t times m and n. Where n is just a number of objects, and the k is the number of clusters, t is the number of iterations, And the normal k and the t should be way smaller at that end. Right? And often terminates as a local optimum point. And then also, there are several other weaknesses. Then what about the category data, probably difficult. It needs to satisfy K, the number of clusters in advance. And it is unable to handle noisy data and outliers. So probably in advance, you need your model\u2019s kind of noisy or outliers, as I said, probably you can operate with a hierarchy of algorithms, and try to remove some, unless or you can use another method to remove the outliers first. Otherwise, what is better? Small k or large k? What do you mean? There's a lot When k is common or when k is bigger, min, which 1 is better? We'll go back to your question and answer. Yes. This is how do we identify all layers? All layers? So, for example, you may need to quickly find maybe from the hierarchy algorithm. Did you find the right point that there is far away from the other points? But by either way, just to calculate the mean of the data, then I'm thinking of distance mean or new or other data points. You can find a few points far away from the other points, right? And it is not suitable to discover clusters with non-convex shapes. So later we try to explore more."

We needed to transform 1 into another and the measure of the effort becomes the distance measure. For example, the distance between these 2 people can change the jazz color and change the air in the shape of blah, the change in the hair part, maybe you can use this as a 3, and this can be other. The nature of it, for example, the distance between a match and the same. For example, you have a dress difference, you have average earrings, you have hair part, you have to take it out with smoking, and the lost weight, far back, you have 5. So, this can be 1 way. So, this is the cause of the edit distance or the transformation distance."

So here are the details, somehow similar between the Peter and another kind of Peter. So, as soon as they're following the cost function, the substitution as 1. So, one unit and insertion and deletion should be one-unit relations for both. Why is the distribution between Peter to Piotr equal to 3? For example, in this part, what do you need to change this term? Substitute to the e with the I. We arrive in this, and you'll have a 1 unit here. So, after that, you will replace the t with o. We have another unit, So, eventually, you try to delete the least. We get another Peter, so totally have 3 units here. So, then you can see the distance is like 3."

You have d 0, equal to 0.3, that is or is equal to 0.1, and this one is equal to 0.03. So typically, that's smaller of the vector d is smaller, and there are more numerous of clusters. You have more clusters later. So, for example, this key is equal to 0.3. In this case, in both, I have a valve in this case. By your last day of your days, very small, how many classes do you have?

We are using a lot of boundaries. Direction information about the separation of it, right?

Let's say if q is equal to 2, What does this mean? If k is equal to. What's that? It's q as equal to 2. It is what? The square root of the sum of squares. Right? It's a super-hot and s d. Right? And this is the similarity method that I mentioned previously, this is the cosine of the angle between 2 vectors are used to give us a similarity function. This is what the precise similarity, right? So-called RMSE and this is the similarity measure I mentioned previously as the cosine of the angle between two vectors or instances gives a similarity function. The cosine similarity is one of the most frequently used similarity metrics. For example, what are 2 different tasks? The cosine distance between those 2 text, you can get the similarity between them and even for the images, you can also try to pick up the cosine similarity.

What does this mean? So, and we randomly choose several parts of the set for, yes exactly, what about others, you know, what is the cross-validation? Let's say about 5k for my cross-validation. Okay. You have 5 more. Let's say, in this instance. In 5-fold cross-validation the randomness level 4, a training and another one as a test This is the 1 time. And in the second time, we make sure this is a training as this 1 is a test. The second idea is tried to let us start at first. Look at the cluster and we decide whether they're lacking, they're lucky or not, right? How the way it should distribute that to this kind of experts? Right?

So, once you see this kind of sign, you will notice that as this is, like, highly suggested that 2 clusters you know, data should be the optimal K. And yet, right, because you cannot see any significant difference and this is technically what determines the number of clusters is known as the knee finding or elbow finding after now, does that answer your question? How can I find out if it's an optimal case? The other function, then let's do what. And try to plot out the object function, right, and find some significant chance so that you can find the optimal K for the dataset. As this is just a 1 sign and you determine the k, you know, anyway, it is not always correct. There. But you should notice that the optimal K should be around in this area.

Let's say, where data points are very high, it will take you a long time to compute it. This is data points, again and again, right? Because let's say, because each iteration you need, to calculate the distance for many times, and this has done business. It is difficult to find the t2 clusters because they are made irrelevant or redundant in the features. And all the points are equally closed. Here are just some easy solutions, for example, above the dimensionality reduction You don't remember what kind of method can you use it for it. We can use PCA. Right. This will be a good way. Another 1, what about the features, the next step? We can then choose a portion of features, right, instead of half of them. Another way, like, clustering, you do some random projection.

And then here's another way first off, we have all features, then we try to get a little bit of search. So, then we'll find the features.

That's a bit anyway, you guys need to remember about how you implement the k means. So, you have to figure out the steps. Right?

So, in the m step. It computes the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters by maximizing the expected likelihood found on the E step. Finally, the parameters found on the M step are then used to begin another E step, and the process is repeated. Until, you'll find that an edge of the likelihood. eventually, you can estimate of some annoying competitors. A little bit confuses Right? So, later, we will find some examples.

For a Gaussian distribution, the MLE estimates for mu and sigma are simply the sample mean and sample standard deviation, respectively, of the data points. Expectation-Maximization (EM) is a more advanced method to estimate parameters when dealing with more complex models like Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM).

The form of the GM distribution is governed by the parameters pi, mu and sigma. One way to get them is by maximum likelihood. Given these p x, you remember about this blah blah. So, and then you got n observations. And you can get log likelihood function like this one. Is this correct? Your first step, you take the log. Right? Take the log of this 1. So, then you've got more in here. Right? And then in this case, you would have multiple n here, but let's say, if you try to solve this equation, do you have any problem with you? For example, let's try to solve the parameter mu k here. In the previous weeks. Even let's say if you want to get some mu k. How will you do here? What kind of steps you needed to take here? Gradient. Right? For example, in this case, can you able to get any opinion of it? Gotcha. You need a time to calculate it. That's to the next slide."

In the case of just one Gaussian, the logarithm helped get rid of the exponential function, but now there is a summation between the logarithm and the exponential.

The PS, right, previously, just a brief mention of why we get this equation overall process, how do we can get at this kind of information using different pi k, a probability, and a different number of gaussian function. Right? So, from the previous review, you guys can see that how we can get the p x. Right? You got it. So, purpose what you find is the minus that that will respond to you.

X and z so that you get this posterior from it. Right? So next time, if someone might ask you what is posterior probabilities. We shall view pi k as the prior probability of zk = 1, and the quantity gamma zk as the corresponding posterior probability once we have observed x. as we shall see later, gamma zk can also be view as the responsibility that component k takes for explaining the observation x. This part is what? You remember? What is this part? We just mentioned, what is it? What? Yes. It is a category like a posterior probability. I mean, worries. Eventually what is the probability of this 1. This is what kind of function. It's just the 1 gaussian function. Right? The previous information. Right? Because it is just about the p x. Right? P x is what? It's just about the gaussian function. What about this 1? probability equals to 1, you've mentioned this as well. It's just a pi k. Right? It's probably h gaussian function. The denominator is just the last sum of all these kinds of K, but it functions well. So, this is about Posterior probability. So that it had to maintain it in this way. And usually, we will calculate it in the first step of the experiment. So that we are gonna use this slide again. So, in this case, we will view pi k as posterior possibility of zk equal to 1.

We expect the derivatives to mu K is 0. Let's try to see what's the answer for the mu K here. Let's see. So, remember, you'll find p x over sigma is this equal. Right? But now the first step, you calculate the derivative of this line with respect to the mu K. Write down the first results on this 1. So, if xn here you can write as like this equation. So, you can think about, this is just x minus mu with the square. This is the equation. You can put this sum up. Just pay attention to this 1. This is going, blah, blah. You have results? But you should write down something. Just a point. You get it. What is the just about to? The first part should be just like this. So, next, and you need to take care of the inside of the bracket. What is the derivative of this part? you should think about basically this part, this part is ex. What is the derivative of ex. it Should be also equal to EX. Right? So, in that case, for this part, it's constant. The result maintained. What does this mean? It means that if you have ex here, the next e x is equal to e x. Yeah. Next you need to calculate the derivative with respect to this part. But what is the answer for this part?  you can just think about it, it has a square of x minus mu, square times of the sigma. So, eventually, so it should be similar with this 1. But you should have some blah blah blah. But That mean, the first part is correct, right, get the first part. Actually, you should be like this. Alright. It doesn't matter. It's just used the same thing here. Hey, right. Let's try to have 5- or 10-minutes break. Once finished, we will try to calculate how you can get this mu K. You can think a little bit more, that will help you solve it. Okay. For this part, you can use gamma n k to be represent these 4 parts. But I need to tell them, and this part just use batch again, then replace this 1, and then try to see how you can solve this, get mu K. Is that clear? Good?"

Use these to evaluate the responsibilities and consider expected complete-data log likelihood, where responsibilities are computed using theta old. We are implicitly \u2018filling in\u2019 latent variables with best guess and keep the responsibilities fixed and maximizing with respect to the parameters give the previous results. In this case, we still need to calculate the gradient with respect to the mu K, sigma k, and the pi k, here. And then we will get a similar result as before. So, no matter how it's just another view of it. Of the EM algorithm. Alright. So that's in the latent review. you guys don't need to remember the second part, but remember that, 1 way we can directly use maximize the log likelihood to get the parameters. Another way, we can use the latent variable view of EM algorithm. And both of them give us the same result."

You have any idea. Yes, exactly, you need to use the probability of each class. Give me data set that you guys can calculate the probability. 3 different probabilities. Right? And then return is aftermath. Return is the label has the most probability. So, you can get on the label for each of points. Right? Now, you eventually get results of 3 classes. In the data set, you know, has 3 questions. I have run the function. 3 classes, right? Or if you say you want additional work, you actually can run out of the control of each class of gaussian distribution. Now, before you started, that let me ask you guys a question."

For each gaussian function, it only has 1 mu, right, eventually, we just have 3 mu. What about the dimension for sigma? 9? how can you get 9? sigma is what, it is covariance. What is the size of the covariance matrix in this case?  3 times 3? For what? Let's say, for sigma 1 or the size of sigma 1. sigma 1 class. What is the sigma this one? So, in this case, I'll give you a hint. It's about size, it should by 2. We have another number. So, let's try to go to the first slide, the very beginning. The Similar stuff is here.

I don't know whether you guys know about the use of ChatGPT is it just released the version 4 yesterday night.  can any one of you who has that or tries to have a version or do these systems experience? No. Yes or no. That's it. That's important. It's totally the same, but it is an upgrade. So previously, it was ChatGPT version of 3.5 turbo.  This time, they have upgraded to the version 4. You should have a better capacity, you know, is make a prediction, or make other. And also, even force for the image as an input for you. So previously, it can only input text.  But this time, you really complete with the multimodal data sets. So, actually, you can just input the images. In the demo, the issue that a bunch of which are kind of amazing, they can quickly write a website for me to give you my   image like that way.   And also, if you can find some strange document cannot picture the 1 that can find some strange voices during the picture.  To say which part is, not correct, not correct. Alright? I think you probably let's try to play some fun thing here. I'll try to integrate your homework and ChatGPT."

Okay. This is about Thanks. It's those 2 students. They should have come. So, here is by the rule that I want you guys time with a little bit of challenge with you with your homework. Let's say, how do you code it is. How have you tried it before. do you try that? No? I tried using to debug. Using it to debug? Yes. It can debug for you. what about others, did you try that? while don't all of you? No. And add it to commands.  The add commands. yeah, it can. So, now, actually, as this time, you probably are having more of more time to try with ChatGPT. You see, once the ability of you and the ChatGPT which one is better.  Now, from now, I guess, we only have 5 typically weeks left. Right? Remember we have another 2 weeks for holiday. I guess you guys will have another 5 different weekly homework, like you would give a few previous weeks.  Right? I want to like to invite randomly 5 students, and you guys can decide yourself, and do not let me know who is that person.  Okay? To try to challenge it. So, second one, we'll want you. You can feel free to modify your code to ChatGPT. To see whether I can catch you or not? Is that a problem? Doesn't it make sense?  If I catch you, you will lose 2 points. If I cannot catch you, you will get an extra 5 points, and the other one student, I guess. You will also get a 5 extra points. Does that make sense? Do you want?  So now it's ready your time to gain extra your points. If you find if you think some of your homework is not that good. Now it's good opportunity to try it. any questions for here? Yes or no. No. You completely understand the rule? Do you wanna try it? You want it? Yes or no. No. not one challenge yourself. So, this time you can get your extra points here. Anyone who do you want to? And you can decide by yourself later, but I want someone I want I need a volunteer. you'll help me to collect 5 students. And you guys can decide who will play the first. Once I graded it, for example, but today's homework, I will grade in the next week.  Right? Once I finish, then you can let me know who is that student with ChatGPT. If I completely did not detect you, you can get an extra 5 points.  Doesn't make sense. Yes, or no? Ruslan. What's your idea about it? That's interesting. Interesting. You want it. So later how many of you guys decide by yourself? And maybe who can collect that name for me.  Correct the name for me. You want to? Yeah. Okay. You can ask the roommates. Oh, well, no roommates, is your classmates. Who wants to participate in this how to say, part of. But you will feel free to modify the code.  In a way that I cannot detect you. Right? That should be good away to do that. And do not let me know the person, unless I have ready to give you grades. You can let me know. Which one is that person use ChatGPT.  Why I want to do this? Because I think, for a majority of you is just in order to check it. Typically, I think this is the very fighting tool, and it is like huge generation of the AI.  And I don't know whether a guy heard about the AICG. You heard about the AICG, what is the AICG here? It's called unofficial intelligence for our content generations of the AICG.  So, this is actually A new generation, once the ChatGPT becomes so popular, right? Once the ChatGPT releases online into the text less than several days, that I think one trillion users, which is a crazy number.  And you guys, maybe you need to play with it, to see whether it can save your time? But the key thing is that you need to use it as a tool. You'll have yourself understand that the questions.  Especially when sometimes has seen the nowadays. It's grammar. You feel very good job when you're writing some challenges of that work. Yeah. But try it. You can get some good result, obviously, I'll hit.  Okay. Is that clear? Well, everybody What is did they use that at your PMT? If you did not use it, you just do normally as your assignments, submit it normally. But so, the wrong students, I guess, you will still get a 5 voice.  Okay. But as you see, definitely, you guys will need someone, 1 student, only 1 student in the per assignment. I do not need all of you participate in. Okay. So, for example, in today's homework, only one of you is submitted with ChatGPT. Okay. This is whether I can detect you or not. Because this is also very important to us.  Because of our faculty because our computer science may be a little bit challenged, but of course, some arts major, like some history major many some students use it to write some CCs and the plus and per visit, they can't really   cannot detect it, which should cause a disaster for them.  Now, I really want to challenge myself to see whether I can detect, if you use that or not. But again, if you use this, like, put away, they're saying you can complete understand code. They're also primary, because now they codes are online everywhere. People are just copy you here. Copy there. It's just more like the collection of code. No matter how, right?  It's just a 1-way question. We will try to Google a problem, it'll give you some solution, and then a solution also. I believe some of you who might be using some code from online, right, just to give us a similar way.  But the policy says that ChatGPT they can output some most likely correct answer. But you need it to your pay attention to that, sometimes it can give you some wrong answer. So, you need to double verify above it. Okay."

It is purely depending on the distance between dataset. Right? K-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centers or cluster centroid), serving as a prototype of the cluster. This results in a partitioning of the data space into Voronoi cells. K-means clustering minimizes within-cluster variances (squared Euclidean distances), but not regular Euclidean distances, which would be the more difficult Weber problem: the mean optimizes squared errors, whereas only the geometric median minimizes Euclidean distances."

What you need to do is that you try to calculate the distance between the detected item with existing ones so that you will tell which one it is most like. So, now it's very similar to that stuff. So, in this case, you will classify this man and what? That's what? It's more like a desktop. Why? Because it is close to one for instance. And this is so-called the instance-based learning. As you either need, you compare the data, one data set of always or another instance.  The classification of machine learning algorithms into lazy and eager learning categories stems from their fundamental differences in handling and processing data. The key distinction between lazy and eager learning in machine   learning lies in if and when they generalize from training data.  The latter does that during training, whereas the former avoids deriving general rules or builds local models for each object it's asked to classify."

The idea is that in trying to combine the similar examples, have a similar level and classify a new example, like a similar training example, the algorithm is what?  So, give you some new example x. For which we need to predict as class of y, find the most similar training examples that try to classify x.  classify y also more than similar examples. You got it? Well, that is obviously or does it mean? This means in these straight lines; you mean you will do what? Predict class. Yes. So, exactly, it's just a busy, then we'll mention the right because you have given some new example x. Okay, this is new example x. Right? To find the most similar training examples, you need to find the most similar one, that was sort of established. Classify x like those are most similar So you will classify this one as a most similar desktop.  Right? That's it. So now we have another 3 questions. First of the question, yes, how to define a similarity? Any idea how to define similarity?  Yes, distance. Tell me one with the other layer to categorize similarity. Okay. What about others, how do you determine the similarity? We have another similarity. And now if you remember, you guys will talk discussed how we calculate that   similarity.  Yes. there should be another frequently with 1 that we use.  The second question is about how many similar training examples to consider, how many? Do you know, in this case? All you need is to define.  This is actually how I say anything. You probably need to define how many Similar examples you want to consider, right? The last question is about how to resolve that inconsistency among are training examples. So, later, we are seeing more about the answers of these questions. The idea of instance-based learning is that similar examples have similar label and classify new examples like similar training examples."

Which means that k nearest neighbor of a record x is data point that have the k smallest distance to x. So, in this case, if you use 3 nearest neighbors, what is the prediction? For this x. x is positive. What about one nearest neighbor? negative. what about the second one? it can be negative or positive. Because you care about two nearest neighbors, you don't know which 1 is better.  Yeah. If you choose a smaller distance, that can be one solution, but if you choose it to be positive, it can also be correct. Right. So that's key reason the k should be odd."

Which means that, given any 2 of them, you see, there will be a line Between them, and those 2 should have been nearest neighbor. This is for example, this are 2. This also should have been nearest neighbor Right? And also, those 2 should have been nearest neighbor. So, every point like a pair can find in this diagram right now. Yes never. And the second property is for any sample, the nearest sample is determined by the closest Voronoi cell edge. You should be you find this page, the nearest should be this 1. Right? It's just determined by this Voronoi background. So, this Voronoi background help your guys find the nearest neighbor."

But when you decrease the k here, it Allows capturing finer structure of space. We shouldn't have picked a k that is too big. But also, we do not we should not pick a k that is too small. In this case, it depends on our dataset. So typically, when we define k as 3 or 5, like those kinds of numbers. Is there a way to compare the total data points to the number of classes given on them? Okay? I'd say there's only 2 classes, and there's a hundred data. So, I think I think the more classes, the smaller k is, and the more data, the bigger k is. That's a general idea, but I don't know if you're more specific further than that. We'll have an idea regarding his question. And then we just mentioned how we could choose that kind of ultimate k. So, in this case, it depends how on dataset.  We probably need you to calculate the error rates of your nearest 5 or data points. Once you get a k, that's that we can try to calculate that distance between the class to the points. Right? You will choose which k give you minimum number. Okay? Does that make sense? As I said, this is kind of quick conclusion, you shouldn't choose a big or small k."

Let's say, here we add new example here. We probably need to calculate their distance to here, calculate our distance to here, Other than that, you probably want to assign a little bit of weight to mu 1 or mu 2. So, in this case, you want to use a smaller WI, which was a horizontal axis of feature in this example, because this 1 actually is more close to this example.  Right? The lesson previous you think about is, as the green button, eventually, we probably need to update it as the blue here. So, notice that Mahalanobis distance has all the effects of detecting the access which you have. For example, in this case, you can try to rotate it over your previous horizontal.  So now you can move a little bit to this angle. So eventually, you can add a new canal for coordinate.  You're going to find some move.  You'll get a move of the coordinated. So, this time, we actually just have 2 by 2 symmetric or metrics. In this case, chosen by us or learned it is similar like the comprehensive metrics that you guys previous notice.  And then you want to find that by using this weight, you have found that you move most that closing points close to each other. Why? You see it? Now, as a distant curiosity, it is very long run. While you are applying for this waiting, they were trying to model the center but method them close to each other.  And this is key thing that we want to the weighted distance here."

So, the remedy you'll be able to try to remove that your irrelevant features in preprocessed steps. And weight the attributes differently, and also tried to increase k, but it cannot increase too much.  in Your mind, there was another way you try to, like, reduce the curse of dimensionality.

Right? So, that you will know how many modifications you make, and also, I will know, if I had made some mistake, right? I will know why I made those kinds of mistakes. And maybe you guys have learned enough. Let's see what's going on with it. Right? Well, but homework, you just need to submit your own works. So later, if I ask you, you send me the ChatGPT version. Again. Okay. Is that here? Yeah. Good. This is should be I guess about final slide. But today, we're gonna talk about pseudocode. The first step is that you Load the training and test data, then choose the value of K. For each point in test data, find the Euclidean distance to all training data points, then the Euclidean distances in a list and sort it, then choose the first k points, then assign a class to the test point based on the majority of classes present in the chosen points. Let's say, if you already have the y of the training data set. Right? Like, trend y, so that's by using the majority of the levels, a majority of the level in the this 1 so that you can decide which class it is. Okay. Good.

And next, they just load our give you our train and text mat-file, and then you need to perform the KNN, and then report the accuracy of the test dataset. The last 1, will try to reduce the dimensionality, use PCA to low dimensions. For example, you can try to reduce it to 10 or 3, depends on you. Now then, get the accuracy of test data again, to see if there is a difference. Okay? So now you have some time to play with this homework. I will upload it now. You can open a laptop. Try to do that. This can is 1 of the interview questions. They gave the students around 20 minutes to finish it. Have you ever challenged yourself whether you can finish this 1? I mean, the first that's the first 1 and 2 in 30 minutes. Kindly challenge yourself. Okay? Is that clear?"

Like a weight or bags or something. Do you need to know something form KNN model? For example, in the neural network, you need to know a kind of weight. Otherwise, so that based on them, make prediction. Right? But KNN model, do you need to learn something? No? Why? It's based on the number of nearest neighbors. Yes. That's good. So, actually, in KNN model, you guys just basically calculate the distance of all different samples. Right? You really don't get any new weights or biases."

So, association-based storage and retrieval. So, actually, this is just a very naive method.  So, you need to remember about everything. So, we want to retrieval of lender knowledge. So next is about induction learning. It uses specific examples to reach the general conclusions. And the third one is clustering that we have already mentioned previously. And you guys may notice that it is an unsupervised identification of mayor group in the data. Next one is called analogy. It determines correspondence between two different representations. And we also have the discovery type of machine learning that is also an unsupervised method. But the specific goal is not given. For the genetic algorithms, it is more like evolutionary search techniques based on an analogy to survival of the fittest. Last one is reinforcement learning. So, basically, it relies on the feedback of positive or negative reward, given at the end of sequence of steps. And, I'll reveal you guys more about the reinforcement learning in the next fall. We will have a class about Artificial Intelligence. Right? I didn't forward it. So, you will probably hear more about reinforcement learning. And even you guys will have a chance to learn a little bit of high-level cost cutting, reinforcement learning. Directly, reinforcement learning. You will have more time to apply with deep learning-based reinforcement learning there."

So, let's say each of x is a list of attribute and value pairs. For example, if X is equal to this kind of list. So first of all, a person where you already have this person's name. So, here's the name is Sue here, and we have the eye color. That is brown here. And we have of this age. So probably young, any kind of specific age there. And we have sex it's either female or male. Soo, the number of attributes, it's also known as the number of features. It's fixed. Actually, it means positive or finite.

So, remember, last week, we talked about the nearest neighbor.  So, this is more like really a diagram. Right? So, each close by, it should be the nearest neighbor. Right? So that it has a different kind of lines there, but for the decision tree is just purely based on some attributes. So, in this case, we will only have one line here.

As it's straightforward that we want to build a decision tree to classify examples  as positive or negative as you can see in this case. Instances of a concept using supervised learning from a target set. So, in this case, we have investigated just about binary classification. But eventually, for decision tree, you have to apply for the multi-class classification problem. But for easy to understand in today's class, we will only mention about this binary classification tree. So, a decision tree is a tree where each non-leaf node has associated with it an attribute, co-called feature. And each leaf node has associated with it a classification positive or negative. So, this is called a leaf node. We have different classes, right, positive or negative here. And those are called the leaf node. And definitely in the immediate, those are some known as leaf node. Right? And each arc has associated with it one of the possible values of the attribute at the node from which the arc is directed. So, generally, it is allowed for more than two classes. So, here are just three different classes. And then in your, guys, home work, you may also handle some multi-class classification problem. So, let's quickly reveal about this decision tree. So, you have some, firstly, you have different the color. Right? In the color, you have how many leaf nodes, you have? Leaf nodes, how many? Three? What about the difference between the non-leaf node and the leaf node? So, the leaf node is probably just like, at the end, there is no more extension. So, you will have a leaf node in this case. So how many leaf nodes do you have for this color in this one? How many leaf nodes? Go ahead. I said 3. You have total 3? Sorry. Six. Just in terms of color. Just think about the color, not a considered but others, just go from the root to leaf. From color that has how many leaf nodes and non-leaf nodes? One? One what? You have two non-leaf nodes. And that further with us side of this attribute, we will have another leaf node. It's a bigger or smaller due to the blue. We, in this case, we will consider the shape. And then for the shape, you will have one non-leaf node and one leaf-node. And for the size, you will have two, either big or small. Again, so, eventually, it is a structured problem. We will depend on the features, but in the future, you will see, we will be associated with more features. For example, in this case, the shape, so, actually, it's associated with the size. Again, we will consider the all features."

For example, if you leave at 10 AM, if at 10 AM, we will have stall. What is stall here? What does stall mean here? The stall means your car is false, false. Stall here. And the next thing, we will have if your car is stall for long time. And if you leave around 8 AM, you will probably have another long time. Let's say, you try to leave at 9 AM, you probably have accident. So, if you have accident, your time is not medium. So, you want to see why if earlier, you have still long your time. If you leave earlier, you will still have long commute time. Does it make sense? Does it make sense? Why? This is one of the reasons, and other reasons might be like leaving earlier. Does it make sense? Let\u2019s say, if we leave at 10 AM and there are no cars stalled on the road, what will our commute time be? Short. Right? Because, there is no stall here. It's like a simplified case. If other examples, let's say, you have further or other test examples, if at 9 AM, and no accident, your commute time is medium. So, this is a supervised prediction."

But you should notice that this is about the expected entropy. You have about the entropy hour, you have weather, you have accident, you have stall. So, this is about the expected entropy, and this right most column, so this is about information gain. A smaller expected entropy means what? You can do a lot. Yes. That's correct. Exactly, you want to get minimum entropy, or you want to get a bigger information gain. As we said previously, so actually information gain is opposite with the relationship between the entropy, the expected entropy. Right? If this expected entropy is small, so then the information gain will be bigger. So, in your project, you can calculate the expected entropy or you can calculate the information gain. So, basically, they should be similar. You can get a similar staff. And here, you might notice that what is the biggest entropy. Which entropy? Which attribute? Which attribute gives you the best not best, the highest entropy? The weather. Right! So, in this case, you probably notice that so the weather is not that important in the task. You can try to remove it, during your experiment. And similarly, in your today's homework, you might reduce down dimensions as features. You also try to get the most important one.

There is a main node labeled A with three child nodes: B and two nodes without a visible label. Node B is connected to nodes C, 4, and 5. Node C is emphasized with a red oval surrounding it. It has three child nodes labeled 1, 2, and 3."

You may if you want to go to like 09:05 AM, it should be open short, a bunch of different possible things if you select break exactly in 2 minutes. Right? So eventually, you will have what Therefore you'll have so many differences. Your decision tree, will be what? Well, well, it will be very big. Right?

So nbc, they include you 1, and the nb is just equal to 2. So eventually, you have this number. Sum of them should be equal to 1. What does this mean, if you disorder all the entries equal to 1, guess what? It's similar I previously mentioned that you let's say if your entropy is equal to 1, this one. Entropy has these 2 values and equal numbers of both values. It's the probability of them. Are they equal? So, eventually, this one is one. Is it good enough? Why is it not good? Yes. Exactly.

So actually, in the first several number of nodes, with the increasing of your number of nodes you probably have at most high accuracy in your training dataset and your test dataset. However, after, for example, after like 20 nodes, although your training algorithm is increased, by your test accuracy is reduced. Right? So, this is also another phenomenon of overfitting. If you use a too complex decision tree, and even member during homework you should try to avoid this kind of a complex decision tree. But it can be up where you can explore if you have a very complex decision tree, which means that you have depth on your decision tree. It's very big. Right? You can try to explore whether you can get a similar observation or not."

Stopping right? Stop growing in the tree. And in the decision tree, you may need to use the post prune the decision tree. And another strategy is how do we determine the correct final tree size. So, you probably need to use a validation dataset and test the accuracy. And also, you try for your report some statistics. For example, like chi-square test, coming whether to grow in a tree.

Remember, we talk about the net in the deep learning course. Right? So that The SVM actually had shared a similar kind of performance as the net.  That's my reason why SVM become so popular at that time. So now, SVM is regarded as an important example of a kernel master. and one of the key area in machine learning.  So, usually, as SVM model, we are getting kind of better performance than the models we discussed in the last few weeks like this KNN model, decision tree, and among them, SVM should usually and get a better result.

How can you classify this data? Okay. Last one is. Sure. Do you write it in the right time? Yes. You guys thinking about you want to draw a line about it.  Right? For example, this can be one line that can distinguish between positive one and negative one Let's suppose that this line is w x plus b. That is equal to 0. w is what? weight. Yeah. It is the one weight. you can call it the slope of this line.  what about b here? Intercept or the bias of it. Right? And in the left side, this is the bigger than 0, and in the right side it should be less than 0.  So do you notice there is a function that can classify them into 3 different domains that is bigger than 0 or equal to 0 or less than 0. They are such a function. You can do that.  Is there a function f that can convert w x plus b to specified different categories?  sigmoid function. sigmoid function. Simple function. sigmoid function, typically, what is the range of the sigmoid function?   The sigmoid function properly like real numbers. Right? It wouldn't just give you three different classes. Right? So here is something that you guys probably heard.  What about sign function, you remember this function? the sign function once you get it as f, w x plus b, so than you can get a predict of y. what is the plot of sign function? Do you remember?  It should be like this one. Right? If it is a negative 1 or 0 or the positive 1, which is corresponding to these 3 different categories. Right? If it is equal to 0, then it is 0. If it is bigger than zero that should be 0. If it is less than 0, it should be just the 1. Right? It was three different states you can think about why we want to use the sign function of it."

But now let's try to look at the details of those so called max margin. So in here, in this blue line is so called maximum margin. As you can see, it is very thick.  So what about these three points? What are them? They are on the boundary of the module. So what is the specific names of this kind of points? Any idea here. Actually, this is the boundary point is to called the support vectors.   And those support vectors just means that are those data points that a margin portion are up against each other. So in the future, your interview will ask of the similar question, like, what is the support vectors?  What are the support vectors? They are on the margin. Yes. You should answer that. So Support vectors are those data points that are on the margin of it.  Right? This can be some easy question for you guys. You need it, w, you need it to remember. What is support vectors. Okay? And there are 3 different observations. First one, maximizing the margin is good according to intuition because you can directly separate it is 2 different classes. Right? And then then getting in bytes that only as part of vectors are important in the same all those three points may be important than the right.  You you will really care about those margin points. Other training points can be enrolled. Right? because as long as you can find those kind of support vectors, you can determine your best margin.  And in properly, it works very, very well. If we have find as long as we can find those kind of support vectors, your probably can get the very good accuracy."

Like projection draw a line perpendicular to the line and calculate the distance.  That is one solution. So can you remember as a specific ingredient of it? Have right of us. Try the best way. So write down your line here. Let other people know what is your line.  Otherwise, what is your line. The highest one is the what is it? Address on the point. and AB is AB is just the. Mhmm. Write down your answer, you're all. So it should be plus b. Right? b y plus c 0 is that your line?  Yeah.  So you think this ABC just this couple of abc right? Right? What is the small part of it? Small abc is what? Smaller, Oh, actually, you change the smaller to the captical?  what about others? can you remember another one?   So what about Pinxue, did you get some results?  You remember what is the line distance?  No? Don't remember?   who can remember this equation of ditance, from point to line?  It seems you guys are all of you guys are forgot about it. Never mind. So we will review a quick review about that. It is not a very big point.  But anyway, in this case, we typically talk about if we have x, We have x1, x2, so now because it is 2 dimensions. So once we plus in with it, we have w1 plus x1 plus w2 times with x2 plus b is equal to 0 because it is like 2 dimensions.  So, eventually, your w is w 1w2x. So the x1, x2, so it costs bound to one point. So eventually, it can be to a 0."

So let's take an example of it. So remember, this is a line of w x plus b is equal to 0. Right? So if you think the predict class is equal to negative 1, so you get another line. Right? That line is equal to w x plus b that is equal to  negative 1.  And then the other line has a w x plus b that it just equal to 1. So now you have given the 3 lines. So now we already know this is 3 different styles. So what about this case? How we can get this equation.  It is third equation. How can I get this one? Yes. Use the first one to subtract the second one, so you can get another equation here. Right? So next, this is how we try to define the margin.  So actually the margin, it is the width of the margin. Right? Then you find  this equition that is x positive minus x negative. That time with w then divided w. So eventually, we'll get the equation of 2 divided by the norm of w.  How can we get this from this module here?  Just use the first and second equation to replace for the third equation.   So from this event, again, this is like this. Right? So this part is just a right here. Right? So and, also, you can expand this 1, like, with the x positive time with w is equal to what, that minus this is why it's equal to what.  In the next slides, we will try to discuss it, again, how we can know this is just the line, the margin."

So you will have to classify whether y i is equal to positive one or this negative one. So these are the 3 different examples.  Once you try to combine together, How can I get this 1? Is this correct? Is this correct?   Okay. I got it. So you had just single line. y i in this part? Why are you using this negative ones you could view?  Changes the direction of this or less or equal. Right? Once it comes with if it let's say, for the first one, it should be easy. Right? But most this bar aggregate definitely should be Big or equal to 1.  But for a second case, let's say even y i is equal to negative 1. So what's problem in here because this is negative you should change this condition be bigger or equal to 1.  Right? So, eventually, it can get for the all i, it it shouldn't satisfy this equation. Right? Right? Good. So, remember, I could just talk about the max margin, you should be having it equal to 2 divided by m.  Right? Do you sorry. Divided by w. or it is similar as that is one over two, w transpose time with w. Is that correct? It should be quite equal to each other.  That's a significant difference between them. And then we will find another problem, so called the quadratic optimization problem. And the in that case that we tried to solve. for the w and the how can we get this kind of numbers.  We always need to remember what this is quadratic optimization problem. We have a minimal loss function that is tried to minimize its 5 w. That is equal to 1 over 2, w transport times w. So this is the overall goal.  We want to make make sure this is as smaller as possible. And this is a subject to y i, then w x i plus b, that is bigger or equal to 0 for the whole i. here, and this is the overall problem that we want to solve yet.  So in your mind, if you have this kind of problem, how can you solve this problem for you. You will have this  optimization problem. How can you solve it? directive, you can use directives.  So what your point is directive. to solve this quadratic optimization problem. You remember, we we can do something with it."

And for the quadratic optimization problems, so they actually are very well known plus our mathematical program problems.  And many of these algorithms can solve this problem. But one easy solution is about that you need to apply lagrange multiply, so that is alpha i here.  So now in this case, we also try to apply this alpha i in this equation. That is associated with every constraint is a primary problem.  So in this case, we defined the quadratic optimization problem that q i, let's say, that are some of all i that is minus 1 over 2. This should be a summation, that is y i y j x i transposed with x j, it should be maximized.  And, also, you have another constraints that is the sum of all alpha i and y i is equal to 0, and all the a i it should be bigger than zero for the each a i here.

Is this good?  yes, you may get overfitting for your dataset. if you are in the training, you get such a good kind of classifier and then do it on the test, it definitely will not get result very high accuracy.  To resolve this kind of issues so that we define about another margin so called soft margin.  So remember, all you need to remember what is a hard margin. So hard margin that means what."

Absolutely. Well, Another name is part of what? Very good. Ah, please share with us in this name.  So noise. I thought what is this? Regular. Regularity It's kind of. Errors, it is not just errors.  What has this the epsilon that we just mentioned? Yeah. Just in the previous slide? So now you guys already did not remember. Right? It's just the one slide before.  What is the or here. It's just the Slack variables. Right? Now you with 10 seconds, you you all of you guys forgot about what's that? This is just a slack variable. You can simulate it, like, kind of a regularization term of it. Right?  So in this case, we want to minimize this new objective function, and in this case, you should have constraines to this new conditions, and we have this epsilon i that is bigger or equal to 0 for all i and eventually you change this term from for this, this is minus, epsilon i here.

For x and y. So previously, we talked about datasets that are linear separate with some noise with our grade, for example, in this case, if we can separate this red and blue.  So definitely, once we have our single line, we can identify this two cases.  Right? So what about we are going to do if the data set is just too hard. For example, in this case, you'll have both. red in the left and the right hand of this blue, this you may think about probably just not a simple linear model.   What is the solution if you want to solve this problem? Mhmm. Okay. So this problem. We want to classify this red and the blue dots here.  Increase the dimensions. Right? So exactly the answer is here.  you want to map the data to a higher dimensional space. So in this case, even we try to feed our dataset is at spare.  Right?

So the general idea is that the original input space can always be mapped to some higher dimension of each space where the training set is separable.  So in the left hand if you just think about in the two dimensions, There's just a lot of, like, blue dots and red dots. How can you classify them?  The red dots and the red dots. Yeah. In this case, more likely you need to find a circle to separate them. Right. So if you let's say, if you project them, you don't hide dimensional space as this is a three dimensions.  Right? in this case, you just you need a what to separate them. Plane, Is this a plane?  So this is more like a surface. this is a surface in 3 dimensions. Right? After that we can take a look at this kernal function. How can you do it by yourself?  Okay. Okay. Probably we can get back. Talk about this kernel. What is the kernal like, let's start start with this example.  Take a piece paper out. Write down whether you can get this kernel, in a format of this one. If you guys have exam, this should be one of you.  Can you format this kernal function. So you need to think about this should be some phi xi, phi xj here. It means that, and we divide it like 3.    So that you can really notice that this phi xi should be bunch of matrix and phi xj should be another bunch of matrix. Right?   Do you get the point? You should that expand this first. Then write our format in this way. phi x i transposed times with phi x j. you may need a new paper.  Oh, do you want to try it? Did anyone gets some answer? You guys are good. Did anyone get a correct information of it?  Remember, you should write first of matrix. it should be another metrix, so you eventually can get a product as it. You got it? No?   Is it difficult?"

        "value": "And that is related to another important topic called the kernel trick. What is kernel? What does kernel mean here? Kernal means what?  So the kernel firstly means that you want to point the Data mostly be used, like, the dot product of this data points. So this is in the first line, this The linear classifer rely on dot product between the vectors.  K is so which we define as a kernel that is kernel of xi, xj that is equal to xi transpose with xj here, and this is usually how we defined kernel So in the future, you may also need to remember if someone want you define a kernel, you should remember about this way.  You should always can be written in this format with some x i and maybe a phi x i or phi x j there. and here is more details  So if the added data points is mapped to high dimensional space, we have some transformation plane, so that means you need to map x to the phi x here.  So the dot product becomes the k x i x j, that is equal to phi x i transposed phi x j.  this is the key thing. So In the future, if someone wanted you to define a function, you need to remember that. The kernal function should be written in this way.  Right, use it as transpose with another number. Okay. So now let's say, our kernal function is a function that is corresponding to in the dot product in some expanded region space.  So here is one example in the 2 dimensional vectors. as x is equal to x1, x2, and here is how you defined the kernel function.  This is the k x i  x j that is equal to 1 plus x i transposed x i with a power of 2. So let's see, this is the kernal function, you need to write a a way of phi x i transposed that it comes with pi x j here.  Right. This is the purpose of your you guys need to do. Do you wanna try it by  yourselves? Let's probably take a little bit of the break. Okay. Okay. And it is a limit time. let's quickly look at it. So let's first  try to expand this. This is this part. Right? First part of this part, and then you have to talk about this.  Just Put them together. Is that correct? You can probably forgot about i and j. Right? So, actually, you have the i equal to one. j is equal to 1, then i is equal to 2. The j is equal to 2.  The reason you have see so many non equation because you can expand that x i here. in this case. And once you try to expand and get the first part of that is your core first part. I mean, this way, I mean, transport.  And eventually, you should have got the product of them. So eventually once you get the transport again, read the summation of it. Right? I see once you see a solution, you see it always kinda easy. Right?  And once you do it, well, it's too difficult. Isn't it? Right? So this part of you will be just positive. Right? So keep in mind that In future, I believe in the future interview, they won't let you do this kind of degradation.  But you probably need to know how to get a kernel. Right? If they ask some question about what is kernel, you probably need to answer that the kernel is just you get a dot product with this one. Right? And we need to remember about those."

You have a k here, k x i x j.  So now, also, in the solution, you have k x i x j. So this should be the difference between the non linear and the linear SVM.

        "value": "And, here is just some weakness of SVM model.  As I said, it is very sensitive to the noise, our relative small number of mislabeled examples can dramatically decrease the performance. Why? Why it can  dramatically decrease the performance? if you have some noisy examples.  But as noisy examples mean, noisy example means what? In the wrong group. because these noisy examples can far away from your normal dataset. Right? So remember, in the SVM, we define about hot plates.  Right? This should be some lines. The fitting lines can be affected by those noisy points a lot. Right? Let's say one point far away from other points, you may need to consider that the line will fit this point.  So that's the reason why the performance can be dramatically decreased. So in that case, it means that if you have too many features, its better to think about use feature selection and reduce dimensionality.  so currently it only consider about two classes right?  All the previous slides, we just talk about binary classification.  So how can you do a multi class?  mul class classification problem? How can you do that? select one class and thought others are the rest. Yes. Exactly. I mean, this is called. 1 vs all others. This should be a typical method. So, actually, this is the most thing that you need to do.  So first you need output the arity m with the m SVMs. So, actually, you need to learn lots of SVMs. For example, you should learn svm 1 the output is equal to 1, and it can pair with the output is not equal to 1.  Right? And similarly, you have bunch of other SVM models to detect whether it's true or it is not true, which eventually we are repeatable m types so that you can get m classifier so that we can clarify m different classes.  So that is also one kind of weakness of SVM model. So once you guys implemented it, you guys will have noticed that.  What? But you now have to utilize that? The last step? Yeah. Yes. You need to do that. didn't it didn't all love the reports, just this one fact. Can you repeat the question again?  Then you just have a bunch of leftover points that become there on the left. Mhmm. So you will have m classifiers. Right? For each classifier, it will give you 1 correct class. For m classifier, you will eventaully get the m classes.  I'm saying, if there's m minus one steps, it could just take all points include m.   What where is m minus one steps?   The last one step, it is not necessary.  So you need the last step. Yes. because otherwise, it cannot make a very good good estimation. Right? As as I said, this should be 1 vs all others. You have to make totally m classifiers.   And then you predict the output of new input just predict with each SVM and find out which one puts the prediction the furthest into the positive region.  So that's the reason. to predict m times."

We can define as a phi function here as I can get a normalization or stop words word terms, so eventually you try to convert any document x into phi x.  So now the phi x is just about your feature vector. eventually can train on this SVM model use this phi x. Okay?   So nowadays, there are many other ways to convert our text to these features. Like, you can use some BERT, any of you have heard about BERT? kind of language model. Or now even nowadays, you can use some TBT model to convert the text to some features.

So why should we use SVM? They have all some advantages. For example, it can apply some higher dimension in this space.  And in the if if you have, like, a few irrelevant features, you will have some good dense concepts. And for some sparse documents, you will get some sparse instances, and the text categorization problem, there should be some benefits, just by linear separate, you can get good results. However, if you apply some kernel you will get a little bit higher accuracy."

As we already discussed, there are several different kernel functions.  For example, whether I should choose gaussian kernel, or should you choose a polynomial kernel, and if ineffective, more elaborate kernels are needed.  Domain experts can give some assistance in formulating appropriate Similarity measures. You needed to choose some kernel parameters like you need to determine the sigma for the gaussian kernel.  and the sigma is the distance between closest points with different classifications.  And then in the absence of reliable criteria, application is relying on the use of validation set or cross-validation set. So that you can determine the parameters.  And for the optimization criterion, you need to pay addition to the hard margin, vs the soft margin, so a lengthy series of experiments in which various parameters are tested.  You should make sure can get that kind of optimal results in just different data set."

However, you guys already learned neural network in my another neural network course.  Right? And just for 1 person student that Minghao probably didn't know this course. So later, I will send a lecture to you, you can take a look at neural network content.  So in this case, I would like to introduce and advanced topic. That is part of vision transformer. In tomorrow's class, I mentioned a little bit about vision transformer. Right? Did I mention? So vision transformer. Did I mention it?  No idea? So then that you remember that I mentioned it? No. did anyone remember? No. Not at all? Vision transformer is for vision task and it use a specific method to process the image. Exactly. So, actually, I introduce you a little bit about the vision transformer, in our cl;ass for image classification task.  I did not inform too many details. So fortunately, today, you guys will learn more about this standard of vision transformer model.  And then you will have another chance to implement it."

It can represent an input image as a serious of input patches, like the series of word embeddings used when using transformers to text.  CNN uses pixel arrays, whereas ViT splits the images into visual tokens. The visual transformer divides an image into fixed-size patches, correctly embeds eachof them, and includes positional embedding as an input to the transformer encoder.  ViT models outperform CNNs by almost four times when it comes to computational efficiency and accuracy.  The self-attention layer in ViT makes it possible to embed information globally across the overall image. The model also learns on training data to encode the relative location of the image patches to reconstruct the structure of the image.  So, in the rest slides we will discuss more about this part, but here, this  is just a overview of this VIT model."

It's around in the tristan 17, it becomes well popular, the vision transformer. It is solely based on attention mechanism, the Transformer is proposed and shows great performance on NLP tasks.   And another very good model you guys may have heard is BERT. One of famous pre trained model convert your text to tokens. Pre-training transformer models begin to be dominated in thefield of NLP.  At after that,the gpt3 is released in 2020. As that time, it becomes very famous.  And after that you will have several other kind of models, and it based on different version of gpt model like igpt and even nowadays we have gpt3.5 and gpt4, that is released right?  So, here is about overall history of transformer. As you guys observe, that chatgpt nowadays is very popular, and this chatgpt is 1 of these transformer based model.  Now, you will see the powerful of transformer model. Right?"

So, basically, you have that input is about some text. There are some text. I don't know whether in Spanish or another language? Doesn't matter they are just words, right?  And then you have bunch of encoder. So after that, you will have decoder part. What are the difference between encoder and decoder? What is the usage of encoder.  Streaming. Streaming data? What about the goal of encoder here? The encoder will output some arrays of numbers. Basically, the encoder will make some input features become smaller, right?  What about the decoder here? It will get a bigger and bigger features.  For example, if you have bunch of inputs, you output should be another kind of style.  So this one maybe means the text translation, this might be another language, and the output should be the target language's translation result."

Maybe another similar Technology is called skip connection do you remember the skip connection? It is like resnet right? And after that, you will have position encoding. It can help you to remember the position of each word.  And there are several advantages of the transformer.

So this is the key reason why we want attention. So later we will learn more about what is the attention here.  So, attention allows the model to focus on the relevant parts of input sequences as needed.

So, first about abstrcting away from these choices, we need an encoder that we have these inputs xn, x1 to xn. So we input a sequence. So now, you can think about it is just the sentences, input sentences.  So x1 to n and generate across bumpy sequence of contextualized representations that is  Their hidden layers from h1 to n so here is use some h1 to n use some kind of decoder, right?  So once you input some sentence, you can use some hidden layers, you get some representations from h 1 to h n, or you input an x 1 to xn.  Next importantly so called the context vector c here, and so part of here. context vector. This one is called c here, it is a function of h from 1 to n and convert the essential from the encoder to the decoder.  So, actually, it's context. It's like a bridge. That can connect your encoder and the decoder.  As for your encoder, it accept the c as its input.  The c is what? Yes the c is the context vector here as input. And generates an arbitrary length of sequence of hidden states h1 to hm, from which are corresponding sequence of output states y1 to m can be obtained  So why it is the h 1 to hm? h 1 to m is not an h 1 to another h n here. Why? So in this case, why it is just h1 to hm?  Should it be an h1 to hn?   N represent the number of input.  So, currently the number n represent the inputs. It's n here. So x 1 to x n is the inputs. and y1 to ym is the outputs.  So why is the m? Because the length may changed.  So, your input is a sentence, right? Use the previous example about sentence completion.  So this is the input x1 to xn, so this is the output h1 to hm. So, actually the length is not the same, right? It's not necessary to be the same. It can be more than n or less than n. Right? So that's a reason.  Because it is decoder part. You are not required to have exact the same length of input. It should be another kind of sequences. That's the reason why you have m here, is it clear?"

What you did with them? you try to replace that, replace the previous static context vector with dynamic ci. So, previously remember, you will have kind of fixed or static context here.  In the attention mechanisms, actually, you want to develop a dynamic version of ci here. And actually this ci is derived from the encoder hidden states. What is the encoder?  The encoder is this model. Right? And at each point i during the decoder, decoder is this part. So which means that this CI is from both your encoder and decoder, right?  So here is the idea. it should be a linear combination of those different states. Right? You'll have states from your encoder h1 to hn, and then you'll have your decoder h1 to hm.  Right. So, you should able to combine all of them. So, here is the notation here. So, CI is the linear combination. It's just a sum of all alpha Ij, and hje here.  What does this mean? what is e here? So this e is from the encoder part. That's the reason. And the next later, we will talk about the alpha IJ how alpha ij is calculated.  And next if we look at this part, once we have these ci, so now we are able to calculate another state of d, d here is just about the decoder part.  This is the encoder and this is the decoder part.  This is the decoder part, and this is the activation functions, so then we're getting involved with previous encoder and some previous prediction and this CI. So then we'll talk more about this ci."

And then we are calculated the score, basically the score hi minus 1 from decoder, and the h with the j that from the encoder.One of them from encoder and another one from decoder. You basically want to calculate the score of them.  So, it is similar you calculate the similarity, the score is like you have a dot product as that, right?

Yes, exactly. So, yes here is the details. So, this is the softmax, and this is This time you should get the i and j from all in the encoder part, right?

So we have, for example, we have all the vectors. It would be a hidden state from h one, h two to hn that used basically the concatenation of forward and backward hidden states of encoder.   So, this is the x one to x2 here just about input and just your hidden state. The attention model computes a set of attention weight. Remember, the weight is the most important that is alpha ij but this is the most important part.   As I said, your attention is want to calculate some relevant part that is by in this weight, alpha ij, because It get along with All the encoder part, and each of them decoder part. So that's the reason why we call it. Like you can get some relevant parts of the data, because not, but in this case, you should use the t here, because not all the input would be used in generating some corresponding output.  Here is the example. This is a how to tell you how to take the score of the the attention. For example, you have 399, once you use that softmax eventually will get some probability like this. This way.  the context vector ci for the output, y I has generated using the weighted sum of the annotations. It is, multiply each vector by its soft max that pass them together. This just that summation of everything you can have it, right?  Again, the attention weights are calculated by normalize the output of the feed forward neural network described by by the function that captured the alignment between input j and output of each i.   Any questions so far?   So actually, this attention is the most important part, was a transform.   Any questions?"

As I said, it has a very important part, for multi head attention, why is the multi head attention? So previously we discussed about attention, understand. So why it called multi head attention?  can you guess?  why it is multi head?  Yes, exactly. it's similar as your number of filters right? bunch of filters. Right? So now in this case, you have h, have an h head attentions. You so called multi head attention that it It's like a number of filters. You repeat it for several times. Clear?  like lstm the transformer is an architecture for transforming one sequence into another one with the help of two parts, encoder, and encoder. But it differs from the existing sequence to sequence model, because it does not imply any recurrent neural network, like gru, lstm et cetera. And there are three major part, like a position embedding. The multi head attention, feed forward layer. And there are three important metrics here is about a q, k and v so for these three, you will see it on almost all of them. Transformer, more campus. You will see qk and v you need to remember q is what? Q is query matrix. K is what? K is. The keys matrix and v means value matrix.   For the q matrix, it is a vector representation of one word in the sequence. But, k, it is a vector representation of all the words in the sequence and see similar for the v here. It is also another vector that representation of all the words in a sequence, of the encoder v consists the same word sequence then q here,   and the attention weights, So now you can remember, you should be the calculator, something like you need to times q with k transport that divided by it should be the square root of the dk here. Those weights are defined by how each word of the sequence represented by q here, is influenced by all other words, in the sequence represented by k those in weights are then applied to all the words in the sequence that I introduce the embed here."

So why processing each word it allows to look at other positions in the input sequence for clues to build a better encoding for this word.   Is it important? So once we try to look at one word in a sentence, you're more likely to get information of all the sentences, right? So that you can correct understanding the performance of the rule in one sentence, right?  So that in a step one, you need to create a vectors from the each of the encoder input. And also in the implementation, we see that those are just three metrics that you need to either generated by the neural network, or you provide some initialization of those values. These are the three metrics that query key and value typically smaller dimensions. Those should be in the smaller dimensions.  And then by mark, by the imbalance, by three matrices that we train during the training process. Let's look at this example. This part is about the explanation of what's going on with it.   For example, the input, our input is thinking machines. This is input, this is the input we have. Then we have embeddings. That is x one, x two to represent those two words, right?

This is about dot product of them. Then you can represent the word we are scoring, for example, process processing, the self attension word of thinking. Is that position number one?

Because eventually it should be probability, it should be equal to one.      For example, in this case, you get scores remember previously. The scores 112, and 96, because these two scores. And then we divide by h and it should be this number, the squared of dk here. dk is just a dimension of your value k here. Now, when we divide by eight together, 14, is that correct? 100 divide 4 divide 8 is 8, 14, 1, and is 96 divide by 8 to get the 12. So after that you get Soft max. We'll get 0 . 88 at the probability of your first score and the 0 . 12 for your second score.  After now, you are able to do what you calculate the alpha here, right? You finish the alpha. Remember about the soft max? Previous we'll talk about here. This is in this part, we have to calculate the alpha. This is like in, once we go to that example, we finish the soft max. But this part is down, which means the alpha already have a head that is on. This alpha should be the most important part.   And then intuition is that the soft max score determines how much each word will be expressed at this position.   Does that make sense? Soft max score determines how much each word will be expressed at this position.  For example, here. For this word, the thinking is more likely to be here than the machines. Right?

Eventually, we want to sum them together in this part. And then you can look more details, but we have seen from what is done for all the words using these metrics. And they need to import positions of words and improve that using and mechanism called multi head attention.

So it should be a concatenation from the head one to head h.   Then you have the w is the weighted matrix. Again, for the each head, you should be just attention q k v that you have previous q k v here, right? But between them, you should be some weighted matrix.   Again, it's just about some explanations, perhaps this is our input, thinking machines that we have embedded each words, that split to the eight heads, and we multiply with s with x here and with some you weighted metrics, just ww here, and the calculate attention using the result q k v.  This is q k v and the concatenate, all the results, the metrics.

As I said, it's just large because neural network, right? nlp so you have w one has a weighted matrix of a linear layer, then you have sigma as the sigmoid function or activation function. That's the reason why it's just w here.  So this is more like neural network.   Next, you will have this layer norm, and this part is what? x plus attention x is what?  Yes.  that is like, it is a shortcut. It's just like with x plus attention x again. Even your attention get no information, we can at least get some little information, right?

We have 9 16 by 16. This is number of embedded patches. Then you have some normalization layer so that you have after that you will have this multi head attention that we just discussed, right?   Because this is not because you have several different patches layer so that you will have this all different kind of occasion. You can go to this multi head attention. So after that, you will apply some kind of shortcut, remember? And each multi head will apply them shortcut here so that you will not lose some information.

Here are different colors. This party means this vitl first of all, what are those central? , sixteen, forty. What are those numbers.  patch.  Yes, it is patch size. 32 is 32 by 32 and 16 is just 16 by 16? So those are patch size.   Let's look at the details, but first of all, in the bottom is a lighter, blue, like the blue, the color. Maybe this should be, it's vit l larger with 32. And then this should be vit model. This should be in this vit l 16. And this one should be vit b with 16. And this one is the resnet part.  Now, you can see it is image net model. It seems which one is better, which one is better?  which one is better here?  see that performance here, which one is better, which model is better here?  resnet right? It seems those different types of vit model is not as good as the resnet model, right? However, later we have remembered in the imagenet, we have around 1 million images and 1,000 categories. And later has another big dataset imagine 21 k which means that you have 21 thousand categories. It should be a much bigger data set. And then you have jft 300 million. There should be a kind of internal data set from google that you have like 300 million labeled images.   Now, you can see that in this case, it seems this model is better, is vit large with 16 patches. It is better, right? And then if you even train a very big model, it seems this might get much better. What does this mean? This means that this phenomenon represent that your vit model more like to be trained on more images like if you train with more images, it more likely to get higher accuracy.  They said if you train your model use, imagine 21 k then fine tune on the imagenet. You're more like, you will get a high performance than resnet model.  And similarly, you will, if you train your vit use this jft model, jft and 300 million data set, you will also get a higher performance on image net model. However, for those parts, they actually trained on some gpu but for the vit model is actually around months train on those different data sets, which means that those vit model are really expensive, right? You really need gpu to train them.  And so here's just a quick realization of the results, but you guys may want to know whether can we design some vit models that have better performance? Then resnet model. Can we do that? Can you do that? Yes or no? No. The answer is yes."

It should be 10 hours, a week.  So next month for 10 weeks in the whole summer, if you're interested, please send me an EMAIL and include your CV so that I can take a look. I will select kind of four of your guys as briefly mention about the second one. So the second one is about the course video understanding. So basically, it will from the course, from our machine laerning course, our machine learning course. And in this case, it should be develop not developer. It should be good for those people who want to some online learning. Right? So nowadays, for most online learning, there are just some videos upload all the record videos, right? In this project.
